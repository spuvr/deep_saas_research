00:00 According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor, about 20% 
of small businesses fail in their first year.
00:05 By year five? Nearly 50% are gone.
And after ten years? Only about 35%
00:10 survive. And no, it’s not because the owners 
weren’t smart enough, or passionate enough,
00:14 or didn’t “grind hard”. It’s not even 
because they lacked money or investors
00:18 or had a bad idea. No, It’s something else.
Let me tell you a story about Lisa. Lisa was great
00:22 at making these amazing handmade soaps. Her house 
always smelled like a spa. People kept saying,
00:27 “You should totally start a business!” And guess 
what? She did. She opened a cute little shop
00:31 downtown. Everyone loved it at first. But six 
months in, she was drowning. She was exhausted.
00:36 Sales were a mess, staff kept quitting, and 
she hadn’t had a proper day off in weeks.
00:40 And worst of all? She started hating soap.
This is the trap Michael Gerber talks about
00:44 in The E-Myth Revisited the myth that if you’re 
passionate and skilled, success will naturally
00:49 follow. The real secret? Most small businesses 
fail because owners get stuck doing everything
00:54 themselves, with no systems to help them out.
Stick with me, because I’m about to share why
00:59 this happens and how you can build a business that 
actually works for you not the other way around.
01:04 So here’s the big lie that trips 
almost every new business owner.
01:07 It’s the idea that if you’re good at doing 
something, then you’ll naturally be good
01:10 at running a business that does it.
And it sounds right, right? Like,
01:13 if you're a fantastic baker, starting a bakery 
makes sense. Or if you're amazing at fixing bikes,
01:18 opening a bike shop should be a no-brainer.
But here’s the thing Gerber breaks down:
01:22 doing the work and building a business 
are two completely different jobs.
01:25 Let’s go back to Lisa, She knew how to make soap. 
She was amazing at that. But when she started
01:29 the business, suddenly she wasn’t just making 
soap anymore. She was dealing with inventory,
01:34 customer service, marketing, employee drama, 
rent, taxes and none of that had anything to
01:39 do with crafting lavender bars in her kitchen.
That’s the myth. the Entrepreneurial Myth.
01:44 And if you’re already running a business, you’re 
probably nodding along right now thinking,
01:47 “Yeah, why am I doing a million 
things I never signed up for?”
01:51 don’t worry we’re gonna fix that.
Let’s go deeper.
01:53 THE THREE BUSINESS ROLES.
According to The E-Myth,
01:55 every business owner isn’t just one person they’re 
actually wearing three hats all at once. And this
02:00 is where most people start to fall apart.
First, There’s the Entrepreneur this is
02:04 the dreamer, the big-picture thinker. This 
is the part of you that stays up at night
02:08 brainstorming new ideas and imagining 
what your business could become one day.
02:12 Then there’s the Manager the one trying 
to organize the chaos, make to-do lists,
02:16 track orders, clean up the mess the dreamer 
made, and keep the wheels from falling off.
02:21 And finally, there’s the Technician this is the 
doer. The one who’s actually doing the thing
02:25 you love baking the cupcakes, designing the 
websites, fixing the bikes, making the soap.
02:30 most of us start businesses as Technicians. We’re 
good at a thing, so we think, “Why am I doing
02:34 this for someone else? I’ll do it for myself.”
But when you become your own boss, you don’t stop
02:39 being the technician you just add the manager and 
entrepreneur hats on top of it. Suddenly, you’re
02:44 trying to build the future, manage the present, 
and do all the actual work at the same time.
02:48 And that’s why people burn out. You’re stuck 
juggling three completely different roles that
02:52 are constantly fighting each other.
It’s chaos.
02:55 And if you don’t intentionally step into those 
other roles especially the Entrepreneur you’re
02:60 not building a business. You’re just building 
yourself a full-time job with unpaid overtime.
03:04 So the question is... which one of 
those roles are you stuck in right now?
03:07 Because until you get all three 
working together like a team,
03:10 your business won’t grow. It’ll just keep spinning 
its wheels while you get more and more tired.
03:14 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT Phases.
03:16 Okay, imagine your business is like a growing kid.
03:19 It starts out as a cute little baby you’re 
doing everything for it. You feed it,
03:23 change its diapers, carry it everywhere. That’s 
what Michael Gerber calls the Infancy Phase.
03:27 And if you’re in it, you know exactly what 
I’m talking about. You are literally the
03:30 business. Every order, Every email, Every 
little task, You handle all by yourself.
03:35 At first, it feels kinda good because 
you’re in control. You’re the one making
03:38 things happen. But it gets exhausting fast. 
Like, you blink and suddenly you're working
03:43 14 hours a day just to keep things running. 
And if you stop, the whole thing crashes.
03:47 Then one day, you think, “I need help.” So 
you hire someone. Welcome to the Adolescence
03:51 Phase. This is where things get... complicated. 
Because you’re still doing most of the work,
03:55 but now you’ve got someone else asking 
you what to do. And guess what? You're
03:58 probably still micromanaging everything 
because no one else does it "just right."
04:02 So now, you’re stressed and managing 
people. You gave away responsibility,
04:06 but not really. You’re still hovering.
And then this is where most businesses
04:09 either stall out or collapse you hit a wall. 
You realize this thing is eating your life.
04:13 And it’s not scalable. You can’t keep doing 
it all. You either burn out… or you evolve.
04:18 That’s when you finally start 
building systems. Welcome to Maturity.
04:21 This is where the real business starts to happen. 
Instead of just hiring people to help you,
04:25 you start creating systems so the business 
can run without you. Think about it like this:
04:29 McDonald’s didn’t become a billion-dollar empire 
because they had the best burgers. They scaled
04:34 because they had a system. A 16-year-old 
with zero cooking experience can walk in,
04:38 push a button, and Big Mac ready to serve.
That’s what Gerber is talking about when he
04:42 says a real business is built on systems, 
not people. You want to build something
04:46 that works without needing you in every 
corner of it, every second of the day.
04:50 So ask yourself what phase are you in?
Because maturity isn’t about the age of your
04:54 business. It’s about how you run it.
Franchise Thinking.
04:57 Hustle is not a business strategy.
I know that sounds kinda controversial,
05:00 especially in a world where everyone’s glorifying 
18-hour workdays and “rise and grind” mentalities.
05:06 this is where E-Myth hits hard with something 
super practical: if your business depends on
05:09 you hustling non-stop to survive, you 
don’t own a business... you own a job.
05:13 Gerber says, you have to build 
your business like you’re going
05:16 to franchise it. Even if you never plan to.
Because think about franchises. You think the
05:20 CEO of McDonald’s is flipping burgers in a back 
room somewhere? Definitely not. That place runs
05:24 like clockwork. Because they built systems.
Not just systems for making the food,
05:28 but systems for everything. Hiring, training, 
inventory, customer service every single part of
05:33 the business is designed to work without needing 
one superstar employee to hold it together.
05:38 imagine you had to run a coffee shop, and the 
barista who knew everything quit. If your whole
05:42 business crashes because one person leaves, 
that’s not a business. That’s a dependency.
05:46 Systems are like recipes. You don’t rely on the 
chef’s memory you follow a repeatable process that
05:52 guarantees the same result every single time.
Now imagine doing that across your entire
05:56 business. That’s franchise thinking.
Not “how can I do this better?” but
05:59 “how can someone else do this without me?”
That’s how you stop spinning plates and
06:03 start building something that 
grows without burning you out.
06:06 Finally the part we all have been waiting for: 
how to Build a Business That Runs Without You?
06:11 So, you’re probably thinking, 
“Okay, all this sounds amazing,
06:14 but how do I actually get my business to 
run without me glued to every single thing?”
06:17 the good news is it’s totally 
doable. You just need a plan.
06:20 First step? Stop trying to be the superhero who 
does everything. Seriously, I know it feels like
06:25 if you don’t do it, it won’t get done right. But 
that’s exactly the mindset that keeps you stuck.
06:30 Instead, start writing down how you do things. 
Not just “make a soap” or “answer an email,” but
06:35 every step like a recipe. Imagine you’re teaching 
a friend to make your favorite dish from scratch.
06:39 You wouldn’t just say, “Cook it until it’s 
good.” You’d say, “Heat the pan, add two
06:43 tablespoons of oil, wait for it to shimmer…”
Same thing with your business. Document every
06:47 process how you take orders, how you handle 
customer questions, how you package and ship.
06:51 Once you have those step-by-step instructions, you 
can train someone else to do it. And this is key:
06:56 you don’t just hand it over and hope for the 
best. You test it, refine it, and make sure
06:60 it works every time, no matter who’s doing it.
Second, focus on systems that work without you.
07:04 Set up templates, checklists, schedules 
anything that makes the work repeatable
07:09 and predictable. It’s like building a 
well-oiled machine, not a one-person circus.
07:13 Think of it like this you’re not the star player 
anymore; you’re the coach who designs the plays,
07:17 motivates the team, and watches the scoreboard.
That’s how you get your time back. That’s how
07:22 your business becomes a vehicle for your life.
It’s not overnight, but this little by little
07:26 approach is the secret sauce to building 
a business that actually works for you.
07:30 If you have been watching this 
far, it means you are serious,
07:33 so I have something special for you before we 
wrap up, I want to leave you with something
07:37 super practical a 7-step blueprint that breaks 
down exactly how your business grows and evolves.
07:43 Think of it like leveling up in a video game. 
You don’t just jump from beginner to boss fight;
07:47 you go through clear stages that 
get you stronger and smarter.
07:51 Here’s the deal: every business goes through 
these phases, whether you realize it or not.
07:55 Knowing them lets you play the game right.
Step 1: The Entrepreneurial Vision
07:59 This is where your big dreams start. 
You picture what your business could
08:02 be your mission, your goals. It’s like 
setting the GPS before a road trip.
08:06 Step 2: Organizing for Success
Now you start mapping out how
08:09 things will work your team, your roles, your 
workflow. Imagine building the frame of a
08:14 house before you add walls.
Step 3: Building Systems
08:17 This is the juicy part crafting the playbooks and 
procedures that make your business run smoothly.
08:21 Like the recipes in a cookbook, these systems 
help anyone deliver the same great result.
08:26 Step 4: Staffing Smart
You bring in the right people,
08:29 train them well, and empower them to do their 
jobs. Think of it like assembling an all-star
08:33 team instead of just filling seats.
Step 5: Marketing with Meaning
08:37 Here, you focus on attracting 
the right customers consistently.
08:40 It’s not shouting into the void it’s 
about making connections that matter.
08:44 Step 6: Financial Mastery
You get a handle on the money
08:47 side tracking profits, expenses, and knowing 
exactly where you stand. Like keeping score in
08:52 a game so you know if you’re winning.
Step 7: Continuous Improvement
08:55 No business stays the same forever. This last 
step is about tweaking, innovating, and growing,
09:00 like upgrading your gear as the game gets harder.
When you nail these steps, your business doesn’t
09:05 just survive it thrives. And you? You 
get to enjoy the ride without burnout.
09:09 keep this blueprint handy. When 
things get messy or overwhelming,
09:12 come back to it. It’ll help you steer your 
business toward the life you really want.
09:16 So, there you have it the complete 
lowdown from The E-Myth Revisited.
09:19 You now know the truth about why most 
small businesses struggle, the three roles
09:23 you’re juggling that drain your energy, and the 
phases every business goes through as it grows.
09:28 So, what’s your first step going 
to be? Whatever it is, take action.
