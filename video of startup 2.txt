How I Built It: $9,000 Per Month Micro SaaS

00:00 my app does one thing and makes 9K a
00:03 month This is Leandro and he built an
00:05 app that literally does just one thing
00:08 If you want to build a successful plugin
00:10 you need to understand this But before
00:12 the success he was freelancing and doing
00:15 side jobs until he came across a
00:16 framework that changed everything It has
00:20 hundreds of business ideas waiting to be
00:22 built In this video Leandro shares it
00:25 all How to quit freelancing and build
00:27 for yourself How to validate and build
00:28 your idea in two weeks and this huge
00:31 opportunity hiding in plain sight All
00:34 right let's get into it I'm Pat Walls
00:36 and this is Starter Story
00:41 Welcome Leandro to the channel Thank you
00:43 for coming on Tell me about who you are
00:46 what you built and what's your story My
00:48 name is Leandro and I built an app that
00:50 does only one thing and makes NK per
00:52 month Synto sheets is an add-on that
00:54 runs on the sidear of Google Sheets and
00:56 allows users to sync their notional
00:58 databases to sheets I built it in two
01:01 weeks and it has been around for four
01:03 years now All right cool So you built a
01:05 plugin that makes $9,000 a month Tell me
01:07 a little bit more about this business
01:09 and some of the numbers behind it So Cto
01:11 Sheets runs on the side of Wool Sheets
01:14 and it's kind of part of the Wool
01:15 Workspace marketplace We have more than
01:18 70K users in the application We have
01:21 more than 450 paying customers and we
01:24 get kind of 5k visitors a month and
01:27 lifetime revenue probably around 120k
01:31 for the last four years I could say that
01:33 the last year or two years is where we
01:35 made most of the money All right So one
01:38 reason why I wanted to bring you on the
01:40 channel and what I love about your
01:41 business is it just does one thing I
01:44 think that's super cool Tell me a little
01:46 bit about how you found this idea So
01:48 what happened four years ago I was
01:50 building an integration between Google
01:53 Sheets and another service I was working
01:55 with the sheets API So I gained a lot of
01:57 knowledge about it And at that time
01:59 notion released their official notion
02:01 API There was a a gap between what users
02:04 needed and what's available in notion So
02:06 I said okay I need to validate if
02:08 there's going to be a need for that kind
02:09 of integration to sync Google sheets
02:11 with notion So what I did I went to
02:13 Reddit I checked the subreddit of notion
02:16 and search for keywords like sheets
02:18 Google sheets excel CSV all related
02:22 keywords to what I was trying to build
02:24 and validate and I found a lot of people
02:25 like trying to export the information
02:27 from notion into sheets to work with the
02:29 data I was confident to build an MVP in
02:31 two weeks So I just built MVP and
02:34 starting to find users and beta testers
02:37 to to give a shot Cool Well I mean I
02:40 think that's super cool If you're
02:41 starting today where would you go
02:42 looking for more opportunities for this
02:44 type of business i believe Zapier is a
02:46 good place to go and find those kind of
02:49 opportunities So if you go to Zapier and
02:51 you check for example the most common
02:53 SAPs you will see that pair of two
02:55 applications for example are QuickBooks
02:59 and sheets There's a lot of companies
03:01 and small businesses using QuickBooks
03:03 for accounting and they need to move
03:04 that information to check the invoices
03:06 the payment orders and everything and
03:08 work with that data And doing that in
03:09 Sapier is kind of messy You need to
03:12 create different subs for updates for
03:14 creates deletes and everything So if
03:16 you're able to build that in just one
03:18 piece of software that does everything
03:20 you're going to be solving a huge pain
03:22 point for customers That's perfect I
03:24 love that Let's take a step back I know
03:25 that you have an interesting background
03:27 You live in Buenos AIS Argentina Tell me
03:29 about your background and how you got
03:30 into building apps So I first study
03:33 electronics engineering I really love
03:35 like taking things apart and and
03:38 investigating everything I went to
03:40 college College made me literally hate
03:42 electronics So that way I said "Okay I
03:44 need to learn by myself." I chose
03:46 JavaScript because in JavaScript you can
03:48 build mobile apps web apps and
03:50 everything So it took me kind of a year
03:52 Life got in the way I did freelance in 8
03:56 years It's kind of hard You have an
03:58 entrepreneur spirit You want to make the
04:00 decisions and sometimes you're not in
04:02 charge So yeah I was kind of tired of
04:04 that kind of work I wanted to create my
04:06 own schedule for the day just be able to
04:09 build things be with a computer and
04:11 solve problems I said "Okay I already
04:14 have some savings I already know how to
04:16 code I have the experience now I want to
04:18 give it a shot." It was during co that I
04:20 decided to take that that step I quit
04:23 everything No more clients no more
04:25 anything And just decided to to build my
04:28 own thing Cool Okay let's get a little
04:30 bit more technical here I want to know
04:31 about how you actually built this thing
04:33 how long it took to build and how you
04:35 launched it So the Adon is built using
04:37 Appcript Appcript is a language from
04:40 Google services that allows you to
04:41 extend Google Docs Sheets Slides and all
04:45 Google services So that's what I use to
04:47 build the the UI and everything of the
04:48 ADOM Then I use VS Code as my coding
04:51 editor to build MVP As I mentioned
04:53 before it has some experience using the
04:55 sheets API So that really helped at the
04:58 beginning to create the first version
04:59 and and it took me yeah two two weeks no
05:02 AI just stack overflow Google and and
05:05 searching for for everything there I
05:07 love that Let's talk about ideas How do
05:09 you go about finding ideas that can make
05:11 money yeah I'm not the kind of of guy
05:13 that go looking for ideas and usually I
05:16 read a lot blog post X YouTube videos
05:19 Ideas spark in my mind and I just write
05:22 them down I have a huge list of ideas
05:24 And it's funny when the same idea pops
05:26 up different times Those are the kind of
05:28 ideas that you work on But if I were to
05:30 look for ideas I could use I think
05:32 Upwork could be a great place to find
05:34 ideas because you can go there and see
05:36 what people are looking for to build And
05:38 maybe if you can translate that into a
05:40 known solution to offer to other users I
05:43 think there could be some really good
05:44 insights in there On that same note
05:47 let's talk about validating those ideas
05:49 Once you've come up with an idea and
05:50 even potentially launched or thinking
05:52 about launching it how do you know if
05:54 that idea is validated what's your
05:55 approach to that yeah for new ideas I
05:57 usually first look if there is something
05:59 that already exists that is similar or
06:01 the same Is this an enterprise solution
06:03 is this for small businesses is this for
06:05 for individuals you can check the
06:07 existing pricings to see what's the
06:09 potential for for that idea That's kind
06:11 of the first step Then if I'm going to
06:13 continue building I need to know that
06:15 I'm gonna be able to have something that
06:17 differentiates me from the rest of the
06:19 products that already exist If I can't
06:21 find that angle I maybe look for
06:22 something else because if you're not
06:24 able to differentiate yourself it's
06:26 going to be hard to enter into the
06:27 market And then yeah try to find your
06:30 first five users willing to try it out
06:32 right use Reddit use X use Facebook
06:34 groups LinkedIn groups as well Having
06:37 those users using the app while you're
06:39 building it is amazing like it's really
06:41 like the insights and all the validation
06:43 that you get that you're building
06:45 exactly what they need is is super
06:47 important Cool So let's talk about MVP I
06:50 think a lot of people watching this may
06:52 have tried to build stuff and sometimes
06:54 when you get towards the end you're not
06:55 sure what features to include and what
06:56 not to include Tell me about how you
06:57 approach that with your plug-in First I
06:59 need to be able to transfer the
07:01 information from one place to the other
07:03 No formatting no anything I just wanted
07:05 the data to be there in sheets And then
07:07 I started to think about the user
07:08 experience and what users could want the
07:11 data to look like And I realized they
07:13 could want the data to look like similar
07:15 to how it looks in notion So that's when
07:17 I added conditional formattings data
07:20 validation for select for drop downs and
07:22 everything I also wanted the sync to
07:24 work and allow users to move columns
07:26 hide columns So I focus in those little
07:28 details that make the difference Right
07:31 Awesome All right Well before we get
07:32 into how Leandro turned this simple idea
07:35 into a $9,000 per month micro SASS let's
07:38 talk about where the next big solo apps
07:40 are being built If you're a solo dev or
07:43 SAS builder like Leandro you know that
07:45 marketplaces are one of the smartest
07:47 ways to grow and build a business You
07:49 don't need an audience You don't need to
07:51 run ads You just need to build something
07:53 people already need where they already
07:56 are And one marketplace that's flying
07:58 under the radar right now is monday.com
08:00 It's a multi-product platform with
08:03 products for project management CRM
08:05 service management and more They've got
08:07 over 245,000 customers across over 200
08:11 industries And over 90% of their
08:14 enterprise customers use apps on the
08:17 marketplace That is massive built-in
08:19 demand And what's great is that the
08:21 Money.com marketplace isn't saturated
08:23 yet So this is a good chance to get in
08:25 early and stand out while the
08:27 opportunity is wide open They've made it
08:29 super dev friendly with robust APIs MCP
08:33 support flexible SDKs and a team that's
08:36 actually invested in helping your app
08:37 succeed Plus modernization is native You
08:40 set up the pricing and they handle the
08:42 billing and payments We worked with them
08:43 to put together this free ebook that
08:45 breaks down the exact type of users on
08:47 monday.com what they need and where the
08:50 biggest opportunities are Click the
08:51 first link in the description to grab it
08:53 brainstorm your next idea and start
08:55 building Thanks to monday.com for
08:57 supporting the channel Now let's get
08:59 back to Leandro's story Let's talk about
09:01 the launch of this So you built it and
09:03 then what happened did you put it on the
09:05 marketplace and how many users did you
09:06 get tell me about what the launch
09:08 process was like Yes So the first step
09:09 was to publish it to the Wool Works Pay
09:12 Marketplace and then I started to spam a
09:14 lot of famous groups related to notion
09:17 and Reddit as well So I search keywords
09:19 related to the product and started to
09:20 have conversations with users both in
09:22 the groups and in personal DMs So that
09:25 way I got some some first users to try
09:27 the application And the same with the
09:28 marketplace Once application is in the
09:30 marketplace if there's someone looking
09:31 for something notion related they're
09:33 going to find it and they're going to
09:34 try it Also something that really helped
09:36 was having a chat interface in the
09:38 landing page at the beginning because
09:40 that way you can have real conversations
09:41 with customers and with users and try to
09:44 understand what they need All right So
09:46 let's talk about growth Uh after you
09:49 kind of launch this thing you're posting
09:50 on a bunch of forums What did you do
09:52 after that to actually start growing as
09:54 a business and distribute and get your
09:56 product in front of more people yeah So
09:57 the first source of installs was of
09:59 course the marketplace That was super
10:01 important But I realized I needed to do
10:03 SEO stuff And so I started to think
10:06 about what kind of blog post I could
10:08 write that user can find interesting and
10:11 related to notion and Google Sheets So
10:13 that's right now one of our main traffic
10:15 channels And I also use Reddit a lot I
10:17 have a service called F5 bot that is
10:20 free that lets you track different
10:22 keywords on Reddit So I set up some
10:25 keyword tracking related to CSV sheet
10:28 sheets in that subreddit and every time
10:30 I get an email with a notification that
10:32 a new post or comment was added I just
10:35 go there and reply Of course you need to
10:37 try to be not spammy and really give
10:39 value to to the users and if your
10:42 product can be a solution for the their
10:44 problems then you recommend your product
10:46 you say you are the founder I also did a
10:48 launch on product hunt a year and a half
10:50 after launching the the product for the
10:52 first time So that's also was a really
10:53 nice source of traffic not paying
10:55 customers but yes traffic and visibility
10:57 And I remember I also posted on Hacker
10:59 News I got to the front page I was crazy
11:02 the spike you get in traffic is amazing
11:04 But again the same is doesn't translate
11:07 into paying customers It's just
11:09 visibility back links that improve
11:11 domain rating but that's it That's great
11:14 All right Well let's get a little more
11:15 technical here U I'd love to hear about
11:17 your tech stack What kind of tools and
11:18 languages do you use and have you used
11:21 to build these products so TypeScript is
11:24 my language VS Code I use it as my
11:26 editor I have now started to use cursor
11:29 a little bit All my infrastructure is in
11:31 Google Cloud and Firebase I use S grid
11:34 for transactional emails and marketing
11:36 emails as well Mix pan for analytics I
11:38 really love Mixpan because you are able
11:40 to know exactly what each user is doing
11:42 with application I use paddle as my
11:45 payment processor instead of stripe
11:47 because stripe is not available in
11:48 Argentina And I use TIO as a customer
11:51 support tool to have the chat in the in
11:53 the landing page It takes time but it
11:55 gives you like a lot of insights and
11:57 direct communication with with your
11:58 customers and I think that even at the
12:00 beginning is super important That's
12:02 awesome On that same note can you
12:04 actually share with me the costs and the
12:06 margin of a business like this yeah of
12:08 course So I guess in in terms of
12:10 percentage of margin is 90% My main
12:13 expense right now is cloud
12:15 infrastructure because again you are
12:17 kind of syncing between two services and
12:19 you are doing that all the time in real
12:21 time So there's a lot of compute going
12:24 on but apart from that the rest of the
12:25 tools are cheap It's not a huge expense
12:28 Cool All right Okay So you built this
12:30 successful business It's making $9,000 a
12:33 month somewhat on autopilot What have
12:35 you learned through this process that
12:37 surprised you it was crazy to realize
12:39 how small changes affect the business
12:42 Moving a button changing a text or just
12:45 moving things around in the UI can have
12:47 such a profound impact Sometimes just
12:49 small decisions make a lot of difference
12:51 At the beginning we had a free plan And
12:53 I realized that a lot of users were just
12:55 using the free plan and that was enough
12:57 for them They didn't needed to pay So I
12:59 made a decision to remove the free plan
13:01 It was risky There was a lot of people
13:03 angry about that But basically in that
13:05 moment we went from 5K to 8K in few
13:08 months I think So yeah just a small
13:09 decision that makes a huge different to
13:11 the business That's amazing insight I'd
13:13 love to hear about what your typical day
13:15 in the life looks like You're running an
13:17 ad that makes $9,000 a month What does a
13:19 typical day look like for you in
13:21 Argentina so I have a 2-year-old child
13:25 We usually wake up at 7 7:30 Prepare
13:28 some mates breakfast I go with him to
13:30 the kinderg After that I'm ready to to
13:33 start working I usually work in a spikes
13:35 So when I have to do development I kind
13:37 of put together a lot of task do a huge
13:40 spike of work and then I chill spike
13:42 chill That's kind of my way of working
13:45 And I try to do things that are going to
13:46 make a difference If I see that a task
13:48 or something is not going to move the
13:50 needle I just don't do it and focus my
13:52 time in something else Cool Last
13:55 question that we ask all founders who
13:56 come on Starter Story uh if you could
13:58 stand on Leandro's shoulders when you
14:01 were you know a freelancer trying to
14:02 find that business idea what advice
14:04 would you give him yeah I think it's
14:05 super important to at least find your
14:07 first user that is willing to pay for
14:09 your application What happened to me
14:11 with some other products is that you
14:13 build it for free first you have a lot
14:15 of usage and as soon as you start
14:17 charging then they don't use the
14:19 application anymore So that's the moment
14:21 when you realize that there was not
14:22 enough value for them So charging from
14:24 the beginning I think is super important
14:26 Do not waste time building something
14:28 that no one is going to be willing to
14:29 pay for And then when you realize that
14:32 it's going to work just go for it All
14:34 right Well that was great Thanks for
14:35 coming on Leandro I love your story I
14:37 love the business that you built
14:39 Hopefully you'll be building a bunch
14:40 more cool plugins and grow to 100K MR
14:43 And we'll see you next time Thanks for
14:45 coming on Thank you for having me It was
14:47 super fun I wanted to thank Leandro
14:49 again for coming on the channel I love
14:50 his story because he's proof that you
14:53 can take a simple idea and turn it into
14:55 a really solid business My favorite part
14:58 about his business is that although it's
14:59 not a massive huge million-dollar
15:01 business it's a super cool business that
15:03 kind of works on autopilot it's great
15:05 for developers and again like we said it
15:07 just does one thing If you're interested
15:09 in building something similar and you're
15:11 serious about actually doing this I'd
15:13 encourage you to check out Starter Story
15:15 Build In 2 weeks you'll come up with an
15:17 idea you'll build it and you'll launch
15:19 it and come out the other side with a
15:21 real live production app I'll put the
15:24 link in the description if you want to
15:25 check that out But otherwise thank you
15:27 guys for watching I'll see you in the
15:28 next one Peace
