00:00 the human brain is not wired to come up
00:02 with a good business idea Ego bias and
00:06 overthinking it often gets in the way So
00:08 what if you could outsource the whole
00:10 process to AI ai
00:13 Well the models just haven't really been
00:15 powerful enough for this but it's about
00:18 to change And that's exactly what we're
00:20 going to show you today because I
00:21 brought in one of the smartest people in
00:22 the space Steph France Today we're going
00:25 to walk through something called the
00:27 gold mining framework Six tools five
00:29 prompts 45 minutes We'll go from nothing
00:33 to a potential million-dollar business
00:34 idea and a complete landing page to go
00:38 with it without writing a single line of
00:40 code or copy What's even cooler is you
00:43 can follow along step by step and at the
00:45 end of this video you can have one too
00:47 Watching this video will potentially
00:49 change the way you think about ideas
00:50 forever So let's go I'm Pat Walls and
00:53 this is the Starter Story Playbook
00:58 Welcome Steph welcome to the channel I'm
01:00 glad to have you on So you're going to
01:02 show off today your new framework that
01:05 you haven't unveiled yet which is the
01:06 gold mining framework Could you walk us
01:08 through that hi Pat So I'm I'm really
01:10 glad to be here at first I'm Steph
01:13 France I qualify myself as a curious
01:15 marketer and uh I'm I love the game of
01:18 marketing and and looking forward to
01:20 present this framework So this is a
01:23 landing page for a co-arenting app The
01:26 landing page was created only with this
01:28 framework A to Z And if you have some
01:31 knowledge in marketing you can see that
01:34 this is a really good marketing copy And
01:36 this landing page was created in an hour
01:39 And before starting the process I had
01:42 absolutely no idea about any problem in
01:45 this niche And the cool thing is that it
01:48 takes all the pain points all the
01:50 wording from the people in this industry
01:54 and put them in the landing page So it's
01:56 it's literally telling the customer
02:00 their pain point in their own language
02:02 and on boarding Okay All right Let's
02:05 dive in Steph can we go over what is the
02:08 first step of the framework so the first
02:10 step is to find a market to explore The
02:13 idea is to start with what you have some
02:17 edge or what you are interested in
02:19 within the three core markets which are
02:22 health wealth and relationship which are
02:25 markets which for sure people are okay
02:28 to spend money So you are already
02:29 reducing the risk So let's take an
02:32 example and we would only open the
02:34 health market Within this market we have
02:37 a lot a lot of categories and
02:40 subcategories and niches and subniches
02:43 and sub
02:44 subniches We can go very very deep in
02:47 this market But for now let's say for
02:49 example you are you are really into
02:53 stress management but you think like
02:55 okay that's not enough I want more
02:57 stress management Fine In this case we
02:59 are going to use a prompt It's the
03:02 market idea expander And the goal is
03:05 that if you put a subniches any subniche
03:09 or subcategory it will continue expand
03:12 in the category you want to dig into And
03:16 this is a little trick Markdown is a
03:18 language that needs to be used as much
03:21 as possible when we talk with LLM So
03:24 instead of just copy and past it works
03:26 as well but it's really better if we
03:28 copy as markdown So we keep the
03:30 structure of the prompt The LLM we work
03:32 with doesn't matter You can pick the one
03:35 you like I tend to prefer working with
03:38 clo for different reasons The first is
03:41 that I think it's the most human like
03:44 LLM Yeah So the copyrightiting is good
03:46 and it's there is more emotion in the
03:49 copyrightiting I always tend to go with
03:50 cloud whenever I can and when I need
03:53 something specific for example the 1
03:55 million token uh context window in the
03:57 same conversation then I would go with
03:59 Germany for example But for the sake of
04:01 this example we won't go too far into
04:04 the the size So we will work with cloth
04:07 All right So I simply copy the code and
04:10 I just did CtrlV and then I have the
04:13 prompt that is copied here And that's
04:15 fine if it looks like that It's just
04:17 that clothes reads the markdown this row
04:20 Now it says okay I'm I'm ready to help
04:22 you Just tell me which market do you
04:24 want to go into So we said to stress
04:26 management and now we have at at first
04:29 we have health and this is stress
04:30 management and then
04:32 now below stress management we have
04:35 physical stress relief massage therapy
04:38 breathing techniques mental stress
04:40 management and then within those we have
04:42 meditation guided meditation mindfulness
04:44 meditation All those potential markets
04:48 can be the market that you are going to
04:49 explore And now the decision is for you
04:53 to first it's with what you like then
04:56 it's what you have an edge on which
04:58 means do you have knowledge do you have
05:01 network do you have anything that can be
05:04 uh at your advantage to go in this
05:06 market or if you don't have any then
05:08 just pick one that sounds good Okay so
05:11 we talked about how to finding a market
05:13 Now how do we validate that there's
05:14 demand for this market or what do we do
05:17 next when we first pick a market we we
05:21 don't know if it's a good market to go
05:23 in And that's what the step two is all
05:25 about We use Google as well as a Chrome
05:28 extension which is keyword everywhere to
05:31 quickly find the volume of search and
05:34 all related keywords that can orientate
05:37 us until we find something that is
05:39 interesting to go further to to dig
05:41 deeper and then we look at the list that
05:44 we have For example let's say Swedish
05:48 massage It's still a big one And then I
05:53 could find potentially another subniche
05:56 by looking into the different program
05:58 What do we have best massage technique
06:01 massage therapy description Swedish
06:02 massage history Okay if I go down I have
06:06 Swedish massage near me Okay 20 20,000
06:10 search This is a very interesting query
06:14 And then we use Google Trends which is
06:16 one of the best tools to use when it
06:18 comes to market research to know if we
06:20 have a trending market or at least a
06:23 stable market And now we have switch
06:25 message and we want to understand the
06:27 difference between search term and topic
06:30 Topic will basically take all the
06:33 related search term on Google and also
06:36 in all different languages So when you
06:38 have a topic it's already like it's a
06:40 big thing Sometimes you only have search
06:42 term but when you have topic you just
06:44 use the topic and for this sake uh we
06:46 can see that is the trending market
06:48 actually it's not too bad there is some
06:50 kind of uh going down and we can see
06:54 that probably here in COVID where it was
06:57 not crazy it's a well trend because
07:00 usually when a trend has so much
07:03 research you won't see those very big
07:05 pike here you have them so I wouldn't
07:08 say it's a solid trend because we can
07:10 see it's up and down but it's a good
07:12 trend So we know for Swedish message
07:15 it's a good one but it could be better
07:18 Now let's look at other ones For example
07:20 if I go back to my tree core markets and
07:23 I go to relationship here in family
07:27 relationship we have parenting Within
07:30 parenting we obviously have a lot of
07:33 things way more than that But one that I
07:35 have explored previously and that I
07:37 found there is a lot of demand is
07:40 co-arenting And if I start digging into
07:43 co-arenting let's see what we have So
07:46 here we have 40,000 search And if we dig
07:50 into it a little bit more we can see
07:52 co-arenting app That's interesting Which
07:54 means people are already aware that
07:58 there are apps out there maybe or
07:59 they're looking for it Okay Carenting
08:01 concealing So that means I have a
08:03 problem I'm looking for a solution
08:05 Co-parenting classes Okay I I need
08:08 someone to help me Those are very good
08:11 signs And now if I do the same and I use
08:15 Google trend and here I have a topic
08:18 again which is
08:20 cool This is a good solid trend So there
08:25 there are le less fluctuation and it's a
08:28 growing trend So here we are not talking
08:30 about all the AI huge trend that goes up
08:34 and down and the tool comes up and it
08:36 dies 3 months after Here we are talking
08:38 about human needs Yeah Society changes
08:42 that creates needs that are growing and
08:44 growing and growing and those markets
08:47 are big So creating a business in the
08:50 co-arenting niche it's totally viable
08:53 Doesn't mean that as long as soon as you
08:55 are in the caparinting niche you succeed
08:57 But at least it's definitely possible to
08:60 find a problem and solve it in the
09:02 coparing niche Okay so we validated the
09:05 demand Now what do we do next we are now
09:08 at the third step of the framework We
09:10 want to gather data Now we need to find
09:14 where are the people talking about their
09:17 frustrations their pain about
09:20 co-arenting specifically and the best
09:22 mind we actually have is Reddit Why
09:26 because Reddit is literally the place on
09:29 the internet where the world is talking
09:33 and the world is sharing their program
09:34 because there is this anonymous kind of
09:37 mindset and long conversation on Reddit
09:39 that makes it a real gold mine when it
09:42 comes to find customer pain points So in
09:44 the step three we go on Google to find
09:49 Reddit threads But we will use a special
09:52 special query with advanced search on
09:55 Google to surface the Reddit threads
09:59 where people are talking about their
10:02 problem expressing their pain So we go
10:05 straight to the point straight where the
10:07 important part is for us together So I
10:11 think I feel I was I have been uh I
10:15 experienced all the the the words that
10:19 that would filter someone that is
10:22 experiencing or explaining or asking
10:24 about a specific problem It's not 100%
10:27 right but it filters a lot of answer
10:31 compared to what we could have only with
10:32 the Reddit search So I simply copy this
10:35 one which you also have here within the
10:39 document is the Google query So you have
10:41 market to explore You just put your
10:43 market here Copy that and go on
10:47 Google And now this is the moment where
10:50 we need to be careful and do the thing I
10:52 mentioned earlier which is carefully say
10:56 read and choose the right thread In this
10:59 case we're not spending going to spend
11:00 an hour reading but I I would tend to
11:03 always go into it and make sure that all
11:06 the subreddit that I chose are relevant
11:09 For example this one we have 60 uh
11:12 comments and it it was 5 months ago This
11:16 is co-parenting and this is from the
11:19 subreddit co-arenting So we are right
11:22 into what we are looking for here How
11:25 did you make your piece with co-arenting
11:28 definitely about promps just when you
11:31 think you have this whole co-arenting
11:33 thing Okay 40 comments one months ago I
11:37 guess this one is probably interesting
11:40 Share the positive experience with
11:42 co-arenting Why not if you don't have
11:45 better why not co-arenting I was wrong
11:48 Okay Here we have blended family for the
11:51 subreddit struggling with current
11:52 partners perspective on okay we are
11:56 going to keep it short but you can go on
11:58 and on Now the next step is going to be
12:01 extremely simple We are going to copy
12:03 and paste So we simply open text block I
12:07 copy the the complete thread enter three
12:11 dash just to say to the AI okay I'm
12:13 having another
12:15 thread putting that on side Okay next
12:19 one Let's go down right away and move
12:27 up Going back
12:29 to my text
12:33 block here Past thread
12:39 dash next thread Sometimes it can be a
12:44 lot of data In this case we just work
12:47 with a few But if you have like 20 re
12:51 Reddit thread good All right So now we
12:54 got all of our data We got all of our
12:56 Reddit threads What's next all right So
12:58 the step four now we process the data
13:01 And for that we have three major prompts
13:03 that we are going to use one after the
13:05 other The first one will extract all the
13:08 pain points and refine them So we have
13:11 different categories and we have quotes
13:13 from the people attached to the specific
13:16 painoint All right So we just come to
13:18 the Google doc copy as markdown and we
13:22 go back to cloud new chat brand new chat
13:25 and we simply copy here on cloud You can
13:28 just copy like that Now I'm just
13:30 grabbing my
13:33 data and I'm passing here
13:42 same So we have first the title the
13:45 designation of the painoint and then we
13:47 have a small description So parents feel
13:49 pressure to maintain unrealistic
13:51 friendly relationship with ex partners
13:53 for the sh sake of their children often
13:56 at the expense of their own boundaries
13:58 or current relationship And the cool
13:60 thing is we have here quotes from the
14:03 conversation that are related to this
14:06 painoint here For example it's hard to
14:08 cooperent with your abuser which is a
14:10 very good one I find this type of post
14:12 on death like I feel to share your
14:14 coopering success but don't make
14:16 statement like try your absolute hardest
14:18 to do this for the kids We can see that
14:20 those are deep conversation and they are
14:23 all related to this specific pain point
14:25 And if we go down we have navigating new
14:27 relationship while co-arenting So that's
14:29 another set of problem Then dealing with
14:32 high conflict and neglectful exartners
14:36 probably another one emotional labor
14:38 imbalance in blended families I don't
14:41 know exactly okay parents feel their
14:43 shoulder are unequal burden of emotional
14:46 and practical labor labor in blended
14:48 families especially when caring for
14:51 stepchildren without reciprocal care of
14:54 their biological children that's a more
14:56 complic complex one but this is the kind
14:59 of thing that you can only come up with
15:02 when when you go deep into this kind of
15:04 conversation
15:06 So let's uh move on to the next one the
15:08 market gap generator which will take all
15:11 those pain points and a framework which
15:13 includes new parading new technology
15:16 differentiation basically how to find
15:18 good business ideas in a saturated
15:21 market which like every market is
15:24 saturated This is why it's trained on
15:26 this framework Now we copy everything
15:28 Ctrl+ A copy as markdown Come back here
15:32 and then
15:34 paste and let it run Now it's going to
15:38 work from the framework before and come
15:42 up with different business ideas Here we
15:44 have the different market segmentation
15:47 framework is the the approach of finding
15:50 business ideas and those three business
15:52 ideas are within this framework Okay
15:55 Solution one coarent ally conflict focus
15:58 coarenting platform description a
16:00 specialist platform platform designed
16:03 specifically for high conflict coopering
16:04 situation with built-in documentation
16:07 tools communication filters I think this
16:10 one is really interesting and third
16:12 party imagation features that's a very
16:15 interesting one now we have product
16:17 differentiation framework so uh child-
16:20 centered custod transition tool okay a
16:23 specialized application focused solely
16:26 on making children transition between
16:29 household less traumatic with
16:31 pre-transition preparation tool
16:33 emotional check-in and structural
16:34 handoff
16:36 protocols Sounds pretty good And then
16:38 the last part is when we pick a business
16:41 idea which means it's just a simple
16:43 choice This is the one I'm interested in
16:45 We have the landing page prompt creator
16:47 which will take all the learnings we
16:50 have the business idea we want to create
16:52 and we'll transform it in uh prompts
16:55 that we are going in lovable to create
16:59 our landing page The last one is a
17:00 little bit confusing because we have a
17:02 prompt to create a prompt to finally
17:04 create our landing page but it's only
17:06 copy and past Let's pick the one that uh
17:09 talks to you the most and we simply
17:11 highlight it and copy it And now we are
17:14 going to just tell Claude this is the
17:16 one I want to go
17:20 for All
17:22 right And now we are going to pass the
17:25 next prompt which is the landing page
17:27 prompt creator What is this prompt just
17:29 before we go into it I I'm going to
17:33 simply let it run and then I will
17:36 explain Now I just pass the
17:39 prompt and run So this prompt is
17:43 basically as it's made from a research
17:47 specifically on lovable the tool that
17:51 allows to create apps very fast
17:54 this specific tool The research went out
17:58 there on the internet Basically CHPT
18:00 went out there on the internet and
18:02 looked for all the best practices to
18:04 create tool to create prompts for loable
18:07 as well as all the documentation about
18:09 Loable gathered everything and then from
18:13 that I created a prompt that is made to
18:16 take all the data that we have here in
18:20 the in the context and create a new
18:24 prompt specifically for lovable using
18:26 all the best practices to prompt for
18:29 loable Okay so we've processed all the
18:32 data and we've come up with our master
18:35 prompt What's next so now we have our
18:38 prompt that normally if everything works
18:41 we just put that into loable and we have
18:43 our landing page We're not going to read
18:45 that one because it's it's made by AI
18:48 for AI So it's pretty boring but we are
18:50 simply going to copy it and we go into
18:53 lowable and then we start running
19:01 Whoa look at that
19:04 Let's publish
19:06 All
19:07 right Transform custody transitions from
19:11 tearful breakdowns to peaceful goodbyes
19:13 for separated parents whose children
19:15 struggle with household transition
19:18 Transition garden provides structured
19:20 tools to reduce anxiety and create
19:22 predictable child centered handhov
19:25 without requiring perfect co-arenting
19:27 relationship Wow Okay We have the
19:30 features child-friendly condom tool Oh
19:32 nice uh structure handoff protocol that
19:35 minimize parent conflict during
19:37 exchanges Emotional check-in system
19:39 designed by child
19:41 psychologist You have to execute on that
19:43 but it's a good feature
19:46 Documentation that helps identify and
19:48 address transition patterns Yeah And we
19:51 have even uh a nice FAQ Do Bosar need to
19:55 use transition garden for it to work uh
19:58 what age
20:01 and we have a form Wow That's it We have
20:05 it Yeah we have it That's amazing I mean
20:09 there you guys have it That is the gold
20:11 mining framework I really wanted to just
20:13 get it from idea to landing page and see
20:16 if we could do it And we did And I don't
20:19 think there's any video or any lesson
20:21 like this on YouTube currently And it
20:23 just blows my mind you know these AI
20:26 tools and how this is going to change
20:27 how you know how you can find ideas But
20:30 what would be the next steps for someone
20:33 let's say they went through this whole
20:34 process in turning this into a real idea
20:38 You mentioned maybe talking to some
20:40 customers or something like that So if I
20:42 may push one of my YouTube videos but uh
20:45 I have a YouTube video that is actually
20:46 exactly for that What we just seen takes
20:50 one big part of the whole process But
20:52 this video from 0 to one explains how
20:56 you can think of using a quiz to create
20:58 a waiting list asking the right question
21:01 Because even though you have the perfect
21:03 landing page with the perfect copy for
21:05 very specific program in a trendy market
21:08 going from there to having the business
21:10 having an app running is still a lot of
21:12 work and and yeah cursor can do it fast
21:15 but no it's still a lot of work and
21:18 before you go into that you can if you
21:20 are familiar with those tools then just
21:21 build it and and try try it and and post
21:24 everywhere and then if you have users
21:26 it's fine you can go build first and and
21:30 then see but if you are not Sure And if
21:32 it's a lot of time investment and if
21:33 your time is reduced then I would always
21:36 go by validating again And for that I
21:39 love to use quizzes So you simply tell
21:42 to people you show the page and then on
21:44 the page there is a popup that says

21:48 app is in development right now We are a
21:51 small team and we would love to have
21:53 your take on uh on your current program
21:56 Would you mind answering a few questions
22:09 you ask a few questions and you say "Do
22:11 you want us to let you know when the app
22:12 is out there?" And most people would say
22:14 yes And then you have a list You can
22:16 post everywhere about that and you grow
22:19 your list And and you you decide for
22:21 yourself You okay when I have a 100
22:23 people on my waiting list I'm building
22:25 the app as fast as as I can You build it
22:28 You launch it to the list via email the
22:31 the way you prefer and and it starts
22:33 Perfect Okay All right If you guys want
22:36 to get access to this right now and you
22:38 want to use this yourself just click the
22:40 first link in the description We put it

22:44 thank you guys for watching I hope you
22:45 enjoyed this Leave a comment if you'd
22:47 like to have Steph come back on and
22:49 share more business idea frameworks or
22:52 even potentially some marketing and
22:53 growth frameworks as well So thanks for
22:55 coming on Steph That was awesome I think
22:58 this is going to change the world All
22:59 right I hope you guys enjoyed this video
23:01 I really think that this is just an
23:03 amazing space to be right now building
23:05 in AI and building with AI tools And
23:08 look these AI coding tools are powerful
23:10 but they're not magic yet It's still
23:12 really early days I know that this space
23:14 can feel really overwhelming and it's
23:16 moving really fast So it's important to
23:18 have the right system and right
23:19 framework to follow So shameless plug
23:21 here but we've been working on something
23:22 for a while If you watch this you found
23:25 an idea and you want to take action on
23:26 that idea well I'm excited to announce
23:28 Starter Story Build which is our
23:30 platform for learning AI tools and
23:32 learning how to leverage AI tools to
23:34 turn them into real ideas and real apps
23:37 Our flagship program is the AI app
23:39 accelerator This is way more than just a
23:42 course or a video on how to build stuff
23:44 You get to walk away with a realworld
23:46 app built completely with AI plus skills
23:49 that might just change your life Not
23:51 only will you learn how to use these
23:53 tools and build stuff you never thought
23:54 possible but this program will give you
23:56 structure accountability and push you to
23:58 actually take action get it done and
24:01 ship What's even cooler is we have
24:02 office hours with AI coding experts to
24:05 help you when you eventually get stuck
24:07 cuz everyone gets stuck And there's a
24:09 whole other cohort of people building
24:11 alongside of you and building apps So if
24:14 you're curious about actually building
24:16 something and you want to surround
24:17 yourself with other builders doing the
24:18 same thing then head to the first link
24:20 in the description to see if the AI app
24:22 accelerator might be worth it for you
24:24 All right guys Thanks for watching I'll
24:26 see you in the next one Peace
