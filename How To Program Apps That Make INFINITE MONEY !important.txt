00:00 so you want to get rich huh that bank
00:02 account is looking a bit empty isn't it
00:03 let's fix that with a little programing
00:05 magic all you have to do is go to your
00:07 bank account right click select inspect
00:08 element and change the amount of money
00:10 you have and there you go ladies and
00:12 gentlemen we're officially Rich it's
00:14 that easy I'll see you all in the next
00:15 video all right all right enough jokes
00:17 you want to get rich from programming
00:19 which means you're different from other
00:20 people you don't want a regular job
00:22 you're a hustler you want to break the
00:24 system escape the matrix well don't
00:26 worry buddy in this video I'm going to
00:27 show you how to program apps that
00:29 actually make money I'm going to guide
00:30 you through the process of how to get an
00:32 idea how to code it and how to Market it
00:34 trust me I'm an expert at this
00:36 disclaimer this person is an unemployed
00:38 loser he has no experience whatsoever
00:40 viewer discretion is advised that was
00:43 weird so the app idea let's get one
00:45 thing straight our goal here is to get
00:46 rich not build the next billion dollar
00:48 company all we need to do is create a
00:50 project that pays your rent and your
00:52 random door Dash orders this makes our
00:54 job 10 times easier because now we don't
00:56 have to build some project that will
00:57 solve a problem for Humanity we just
00:59 have to build a project that fuels our
01:01 greed okay this is starting to sound a
01:02 bit unethical maybe we should do
01:03 something oh money now that we've sold
01:05 our soul to capitalism we can use my
01:07 secret business strategies for project
01:09 ideas this looks like a pyramid wait a
01:12 minute strategy number one solve a
01:14 problem so small so stupidly specific
01:17 that nobody else bothers let me give you
01:19 a beautiful example I have a problem and
01:21 I assume other people have the same
01:23 problem I get a lot of emails promotions
01:26 alerts reminders and of course emails
01:28 from people who reply to my newsletter
01:29 sloth bites oh you don't know what sloth
01:31 bites is sloth bites is My Weekly
01:34 Newsletter where I share bite-sized
01:35 programming information every week to
01:37 make you a better programmer and the
01:39 best part about it it's free all you
01:40 have to do is give me your email I won't
01:42 do anything with it I
01:44 promise so yeah my emails get a lot of
01:46 stuff and I'm too lazy to categorize
01:47 them so you can make a project that
01:49 categorizes emails and I bet you could
01:50 charge $5 a month for this get 1,000
01:52 users and Bam $5,000 a month wait this
01:55 already exists ah strategy number two
01:57 solve a problem so big and common that
01:59 it doesn't matter if another one exists
02:01 look maybe the email thing has already
02:02 been done but that doesn't mean it won't
02:04 work think about it calendar apps
02:05 password managers notetaking apps to-do
02:07 apps there's like 500 of them but guess
02:09 what they still make that money your
02:12 idea doesn't have to be good or original
02:14 that's right in fact you can even just
02:16 copy and paste someone else's idea big
02:18 companies are a master of this check
02:20 this out door Dash Uber Eats GrubHub
02:22 wrappy holy there's a lot of food
02:23 delivery strategy number three the X for
02:25 y formula look since we can copy
02:27 businesses we can use this classic
02:29 strategy to make it look like we're
02:31 doing something original the strategy is
02:33 pretty simple the x is the specific
02:35 problem or need that you're trying to
02:36 solve and then the Y is the specific
02:38 group of people or Market that you're
02:40 trying to sell to so imagine something
02:41 like the Discord for businesses Linux
02:44 but for normal people Uber Eats but you
02:47 take people wait that's just Uber look
02:48 it's a simple strategy I obviously don't
02:50 have any good ideas or else I'd be rich
02:52 but you get the point right this
02:53 strategy is really effective if you have
02:55 absolutely no creative strategy number
02:57 four the GPT rapper this is a brand new
02:59 strategy thanks to CH GPT and other AIS
03:01 and the strategy is pretty simple you
03:03 make AI do a specific task yeah it's
03:05 that simple and some people have made
03:06 Millions off this like my homie Blake
03:08 Anderson right here you know what he
03:09 made Riz GPT GPT for dating he made
03:12 Millions off this yeah Millions business
03:14 is such a beautiful thing now even if
03:16 you have an idea thanks to my four
03:17 strategies it doesn't really matter if
03:19 you don't know how to build it so let me
03:20 show you how to start building these
03:21 apps you see most developers have
03:23 problems here they get stuck and it's
03:25 not because they can't build it in fact
03:27 it's the opposite they can build it but
03:29 they want everything to be perfect they
03:30 want to keep adding features they're
03:32 worried about scaling bro you have zero
03:35 users what's the point of scaling
03:37 because while you're worried about clean
03:38 code scalability and best practices
03:41 someone else is launching their Broken
03:42 app getting real users and making money
03:45 with code that looks like it was written
03:46 by a three-year-old but thanks to modern
03:48 tools shipping garbage has never been
03:50 easier but I'll get to that part later
03:51 when you're building your project it
03:53 should follow these three rules SLC
03:56 simple lovable and complete I stole this
03:58 from a video from edman young but I just
03:59 love the advice so much so I'm going to
04:01 steal it here I'm sorry Edmond it's such
04:02 good advice simple means your app
04:04 doesn't have to do everything but it
04:06 should at least deliver at least one to
04:08 two key features lovable means you want
04:10 people to use your app so this just
04:12 means your app should have some good
04:13 uiux so basically make your app look
04:15 good I'll talk more about that later and
04:17 your app should be complete don't make
04:18 your app like the gaming industry where
04:20 it's incomplete and then sell you it
04:21 later make sure it's functional make
04:23 sure the one to two key features you did
04:25 make work once again I'm taking this
04:27 from Edmond so go check out his videos
04:29 later not now you should watch mine
04:31 first now I want to emphasize the L and
04:33 SLC lovable because I don't think enough
04:35 of you understand how important this
04:37 part is especially the programmers
04:39 specifically backin Engineers I'm
04:41 looking at you please make your project
04:43 look good or at least not terrible it's
04:45 bad enough that you're ugly don't make
04:46 your project ugly
04:47 too most of you probably only care about
04:50 the programming part you want to get
04:52 things done even if it looks ugly and I
04:54 respect that but you're trying to sell
04:55 this project to other people here's the
04:57 thing about us humans we're shallow very
05:00 shallow you could have the best code
05:02 ever written revolutionary features but
05:04 if it looks ugly nobody's going to use
05:06 it I mean there's exceptions of course
05:08 like Craigslist and uh Craigslist but
05:10 imagine if Craigslist just looked a
05:12 little better design is really important
05:15 now you could spend Years Learning
05:17 design studying UI patterns taking
05:19 screenshots of every app to learn how to
05:20 make a good-look website or you could
05:22 use this tool to help you out mobin now
05:24 what's mobin mobin's a really useful
05:26 tool for design and I'm so happy a
05:28 platform like this exists you can think
05:29 of like the paparazzi for design because
05:32 they take pictures of everything M don't
05:34 get mad at that and they're also the
05:35 sponsor of today's video I knew it it's
05:38 a platform that lets you look at
05:39 websites and mobile apps to get some
05:40 design inspiration and see how other
05:42 applications do things let me give you
05:44 some quick facts about mobin that will
05:45 blow you away they have over 1,200 apps
05:48 over 500,000 screenshots and over
05:50 880,000 user flows yeah it's a cheat
05:52 code for design it's updated every
05:53 single week and their mission is to
05:55 empower the world to design great
05:56 digital experiences so basically mobin
05:59 wants to make every website and app look
06:01 good you can check out how other
06:02 companies do signups logins their
06:04 homepage dashboards checkouts really
06:06 anything a lot of designers rely on
06:07 mobin as a source of inspiration and
06:09 best practices because well they have
06:11 everything I mean look how easy this is
06:12 I need a landing page I go on mobin Boom
06:14 this is how 500 apps did their landing
06:16 page it's quick and easy to find exactly
06:17 what you need no more random screenshots
06:19 no more guessing what works mobin
06:21 already has everything for you and you
06:22 might even learn a thing or two about
06:23 your iux so if you'd like to try mobin
06:25 for free and start making beautiful
06:27 projects click the link in the
06:28 description now that we have our design
06:29 CH Cod and I sold my soul a bit let's
06:31 get a bit more Technical and start
06:33 building your application is going to
06:34 need four parts front end the backend
06:36 database and a payment processor and
06:38 when people think of these four steps
06:40 they usually have to think of a teex
06:41 stack ah yes the teex stack a landmine
06:44 full of opinions now when it comes to
06:46 Tech stack specifically to make money
06:49 your Tech stack doesn't really matter
06:50 the only people that care about your
06:51 Tech stack are Tech Bros on Twitter it's
06:53 X now I'm not saying that and they're
06:55 not going to buy your product they're
06:56 going to build it themselves so you
06:57 could honestly use whatever you want
06:58 WordPress scratch JavaScript python you
07:01 can write your app in cobal for all I
07:02 care the only thing that matters is if
07:04 your app works the only recommendations
07:06 I will give you about a Tex stack is use
07:08 something that's popular that has a lot
07:10 of developer support has a large
07:11 community and that you're the most
07:13 comfortable with at the end of the day
07:14 if you can't get any work done what's
07:16 the point now what I like to use
07:17 personally and this is specifically for
07:19 web development I like to use nextjs and
07:21 superbase and I like to style my apps
07:23 with shaten and Tailwind I love shaten
07:26 and then I like to use post hog for
07:27 analytics to track you all and then I
07:29 use stripe for payment processing so I
07:31 can take all your money yeah that's the
07:32 tech stack I like to use right now this
07:34 could change in the future because
07:35 there's a lot of tools and Frameworks
07:36 out there that I haven't used personally
07:38 but this does get the job done it's up
07:39 to you if you want to use it ah remember
07:42 when I said shipping garbage has never
07:43 been easier this is what I meant now ai
07:45 is not perfect and people have mixed
07:47 opinions about it for programming my
07:49 advice would be if the goal of this
07:50 project is to learn I don't recommend
07:52 using it but in our case it's to sell
07:53 out and make money so who cares now
07:55 obviously AI isn't perfect it's not
07:57 going to give you the entire project yet
07:59 but I will say it's very helpful to get
08:01 stuff done fast specifically annoying
08:02 stuff AI is a very helpful tool no
08:05 matter how you look at it now there's
08:06 levels to how you can use AI we got the
08:08 normi level which is just the basic AI
08:10 chats like chat GPT Claud Gemini does
08:13 anyone actually use the Gemini chat and
08:15 then we have the try hard sweat level
08:17 which are using tools that are
08:18 specifically made for coding there's
08:20 tools like bolt v0 and lovable that
08:23 basically build the full stack
08:25 application they obviously can't build
08:26 the entire thing but they do give a good
08:28 starting point I mean check this out
08:29 I'll use both for this you give a
08:30 description of what you want and bolt
08:32 just builds it for you oh my God there's
08:34 also AI code editors like cursor
08:36 windsurf and pair shout out name AI
08:39 inside your code editors might become
08:40 the norm soon at least for
08:41 non-enterprise projects because they're
08:43 really helpful it's great you should
08:44 check out one of these AI code editors
08:46 but uh where was I all right how to make
08:48 projects that make money you now have
08:49 your app idea that will make you
08:51 Millions all you have to do now is build
08:53 it let me give you the ultimate workflow
08:55 so you can finish that app in a week
08:58 step one get a description and Outlook
08:59 line of the project go to chat gbt
09:02 describe the project you want to make
09:03 and tell chat gbt to create a detailed
09:05 and structured explanation of the app
09:07 because you don't even know what you're
09:08 building yourself yet step two use an AI
09:11 tool like v0 bolt or lovable and copy
09:14 and paste that detailed explanation to
09:16 one of those tools it'll start building
09:18 it for you and give you a good starting
09:19 point step three fix the UI these tools
09:22 are most likely going to generate
09:24 terrible UI so what you can do now is go
09:26 on to mobin and look at any designs that
09:28 you think look good copy The images from
09:30 mobin and paste them into the tool that
09:32 you use to build the app and tell it to
09:33 make it look like that step four start
09:36 programming it yourself even though you
09:37 have a starting point these tools are
09:39 not going to build the whole thing for
09:40 you you actually have to use your brain
09:42 and code it yourself so yoink the code
09:44 that it gave you and start coding and
09:46 there you go my friend you now have a
09:48 starting point to making your next
09:49 million application now that you
09:52 finished the project all you have to do
09:53 now is wait and the users will start
09:56 coming where's the user marketing now
09:59 even though you finish building your
10:00 project you'd think people would just
10:02 visit it normally well you're wrong even
10:04 once you finish building your project
10:06 and you publish it to the internet
10:07 literally nothing happens absolutely
10:09 nothing nobody knows it exists nobody's
10:11 going to use it your mom's not going to
10:12 use it your dad's not going to use it
10:13 your uncle's not going to use it your
10:14 Grandma's not going to use it your
10:16 project goes straight to the void of the
10:17 internet which is why we need marketing
10:19 all you need to do is be slightly
10:20 annoying kind of everywhere and a little
10:23 bit cringe and there's already a place
10:24 that does exactly that social media woo
10:27 Reddit free users Twitter free marketing
10:30 LinkedIn free customers you have to
10:33 start thinking like a business person
10:34 you got to stop thinking about people as
10:36 people you have to start looking at them
10:38 as numbers and money go on LinkedIn and
10:41 post about your entrepreneurship journey
10:42 and link your project and people are
10:44 going to eat that stuff up it's that
10:46 simple nowadays go on Tik Tok post some
10:48 cringe Tik toks about your product and
10:49 people are bound to see it Go on YouTube
10:51 post some terrible videos about your
10:53 product people are bound to see it even
10:55 if your video gets a little views you
10:57 could just buy ads and people will have
10:59 to see it cuz you paid for it so keep
11:01 posting about your project keep being
11:02 annoying and people will eventually try
11:04 it now combine social media marketing
11:06 with SEO search engine optimization
11:08 picks up your HTML and add some metadata
11:10 to your project get your project to the
11:11 top of Google searches you already know
11:13 what I'm going to say people are bound
11:15 to see it and if your product actually
11:17 is good it'll get popular and people
11:19 will actually buy it and you'll finally
11:21 be rich and live your dream life and if
11:23 you successfully get rich from this
11:25 video split me the check because you owe
11:27 me I made you
