00:02 revenues projected to hit over $200
00:05 billion by 2025 the future it's in
00:08 businesses with reoccurring revenue and
00:10 scalable potential AKA SAS companies SAS
00:14 stands for software as a service it's a
00:16 cloud-based model where users access
00:18 software over the internet without
00:19 needing to download it the best part
00:21 about creating a SAS company is that you
00:23 can build the product once and you can
00:25 sell it forever it's a very attractive
00:27 model for entrepreneurs plus it can be
00:29 run remotely you can even run your
00:31 business from the Bahamas if you want to
00:33 I know that I have way too many
00:35 subscriptions to SAS companies because
00:36 it's so easy to sign up that I almost
00:38 forgot that I did by the end of this
00:40 video you will know the steps that you
00:41 need to take to launch your own SAS
00:43 company and create a reoccurring and
00:46 consistent income stream I'm not just
00:48 going to show you how to build a
00:49 business but also how to validate it
00:51 Market it and scale
00:55 it SAS companies have a unique advantage
00:58 in the marketplace with reoccurring
01:00 Revenue scalability Global reach so how
01:03 do you make sure that there are people
01:05 out there willing to spend money on your
01:07 product first you need to do market
01:10 research the most important part of any
01:12 business is making sure that there is a
01:14 market for it which means that people
01:15 are already spending their money on this
01:17 thing the first two questions you must
01:19 answer before any other question what
01:22 problem is your SAS product solving for
01:23 people and who are you solving it for go
01:27 on Google and start researching your
01:29 competition the market size and gather
01:31 all the data that you can about your
01:33 industry such as market growth who
01:35 spends the most money on your kind of
01:36 SAS software and what are the emerging
01:38 Trends in the industry you can also use
01:40 a really great software called Frederick
01:42 AI for this rather than wasting
01:44 thousands of dollars building out a
01:46 product before you even have a customer
01:48 base first build a prototype an easy way
01:51 to do this is by building a wireframe
01:53 you can draw one with pen and pencil or
01:55 you can use programs like balsamic or
01:57 figma to make one it is really important
01:59 to know what kind of interface design
02:01 you want when you start working with
02:03 developers so a wireframe is essential
02:06 guys this is where your creative genius
02:07 gets to come out that's it Patrick your
02:10 Genius is showing where now this tip is
02:13 going to save you from pouring money
02:15 down the drain it is the number one
02:17 thing that most businesses get wrong you
02:20 need to validate your business idea the
02:22 moment someone pays you is the moment
02:24 you officially have a business method
02:26 one you can start a wait list to get
02:28 users to sign up before you build the
02:30 app you can incentivize people to share
02:32 the weight list by giving them points or
02:34 discounts to your software so how can
02:36 you create a weight list you can
02:37 actually create a weight list with apps
02:39 such as weight. Le viral loops and
02:41 Shopify forms or you can even use Google
02:44 forms if it's easier for you but here's
02:46 the best way to validate your idea
02:48 create an early adopter program offer
02:50 participants a chance to invest in your
02:52 software by purchasing a license at a
02:55 discount for the first year if done
02:57 successfully this will prove that people
02:59 don't just like your product they're
03:01 willing to pay for it name the program
03:03 and provide exclusive benefits such as a
03:06 verified status on the platform or
03:08 involvement in feature creation remember
03:10 even if people say they like the idea if
03:13 people don't pay they're unlikely to
03:14 spend their money when it's launched I
03:16 recently listened to an interview with
03:18 Daniel Priestley who at the age of 21
03:20 launched his first company it reached
03:22 $10 million in Revenue within 3 years he
03:26 says the most important part of starting
03:28 any company is validating the idea
03:30 before spending a lot of money plus this
03:32 looks great to investors or future
03:34 Partners okay what do you do once your
03:36 idea has been validated you can create
03:38 something called an MVP what is an MVP
03:41 an MVP is a minimum viable product you
03:44 can create an MVP with minimal features
03:46 to show what your app or software will
03:47 be like you can create this using
03:49 programs like figma bubble Shopify or
03:53 Glide here are a few examples of nvps
03:56 that big Brands started with buffer the
03:58 social media toolkit for small
03:60 businesses first launched with a simple
04:02 landing page just explaining the concept
04:05 of scheduling social media posts zappier
04:07 the tool that integrates all of your web
04:09 apps began is a manual process where the
04:12 founder literally manually connected
04:14 apps behind the scenes crazy I know the
04:17 founders of Airbnb listed their own
04:20 apartment on a simple website to test if
04:22 someone would be willing to pay to stay
04:24 in someone else's home so if you're
04:25 looking to make a website for your nvp
04:27 I've actually linked a free Shopify
04:29 trial down below now the much asked
04:31 question how should you price your
04:33 product here are some potential pricing
04:35 models to consider for your SAS product
04:37 before you think of your model I would
04:39 research what other SAS products in your
04:41 space are charging this way you can get
04:43 an idea of the market value you also
04:45 want to consider if you have any monthly
04:47 cost to run your business make sure your
04:50 price reflects what you would need in
04:51 order to pay off your initial investment
04:53 within the next few years or months and
04:56 to cover your monthly costs now let's
04:58 talk about the different pricing models
04:60 first is subscription based pricing this
05:02 is where customers pay a reoccurring
05:04 monthly or annual fee to get access to
05:05 the product companies such as Netflix
05:07 Shopify and Spotify all do this very
05:10 well the premium model offer a basic
05:12 version of the product for free and then
05:14 charge for premium features cap cut and
05:17 Dropbox both use this model usage based
05:19 pricing this is where customers pay
05:21 based on how much they actually use the
05:23 product stripe uses this model flat rate
05:25 pricing customers pay one price to get
05:28 access to all of the features notion and
05:30 Adobe Express do this per user pricing
05:33 you can charge customers based on how
05:35 many users there are in their account
05:37 slack and zoom use this model there are
05:39 many more options but these are all
05:42 great as Patrick Campell the founder of
05:44 profit well says a great pricing
05:46 strategy doesn't just maximize Revenue
05:48 it maximizes your customers success the
05:51 big question how will your potential
05:53 customers find you or even know that you
05:55 exist and how are you going to make
05:57 money well marketing will will be your
06:00 best friend in this process here are my
06:02 biggest recommendations when it comes to
06:04 marketing and selling your products the
06:06 nicest thing about SAS products is that
06:07 there is no shipping involved so anybody
06:09 in the world can access your products
06:11 immediately at any time first partner
06:14 with any key people of influence in your
06:16 field influencers thought leaders
06:18 businesses and groups and give them free
06:21 access to your platform in exchange for
06:22 them to share it if they like it you can
06:24 also use affiliate marketing and give
06:26 influencers a percent of each referral
06:28 that signs up you want people to
06:30 associate your brand with people they
06:32 trust and respect plus you're going to
06:34 reach a whole new audience this way you
06:36 can use chat GPT or Google Gemini to
06:38 help you find these people and you can
06:40 also use softwares such as LinkedIn
06:42 sales Navigator or other email finder
06:44 tools like Apollo that help you get the
06:46 contact of the exact people you want
06:48 lastly Shopify collabs is also a great
06:51 place to find Affiliates next run paid
06:53 ads chances are a lot of people who need
06:56 your product are hanging out on social
06:58 media and you could Target them to sell
06:59 your product through cgc ugc or just ad
07:02 creatives in general to learn more I
07:05 actually have a video in the description
07:06 about Tik Tok ads and Facebook ads so go
07:09 watch those if you need a little extra
07:11 help next offer a free trial for new
07:13 users so that they can test out your app
07:15 and once they love it give you their
07:17 money create educational content on
07:19 social media focused on your product and
07:22 build a community around it make sure to
07:24 give as much value as you can next put
07:27 good reviews and customer success
07:29 stories all over your front page people
07:32 Trust reviews you can also add your app
07:34 or software to the Shopify app store if
07:37 your SAS software serves businesses now
07:39 what will you need to create a SAS
07:41 product you will need to find a
07:43 developer to build out the software and
07:45 a UI or ux designer for your interface
07:48 you may potentially need a devops
07:50 engineer product managers and customer
07:52 service Representatives you can actually
07:54 find the right people for this on
07:56 platforms such as topt who actually have
07:59 the top 3% of talent wellfound which is
08:02 made for startups or gun.io specifically
08:05 made to find software talent for sales
08:08 you can hire a sales team on a
08:09 percentage basis or you can just do
08:11 sales on your own you honestly do not
08:13 need a big team to start you may need to
08:16 do everything on your own in the
08:17 beginning the biggest thing you need is
08:19 to Outsource product development you can
08:21 also partner with developers to get up
08:23 and running but be careful who you give
08:25 your Equity to believe it or not you can
08:27 actually build SAS softwares with no no
08:30 code apps such as bubble Glide or adalo
08:33 so go give those ones a try the downside
08:36 is that you don't fully own the software
08:38 because it is run on their platform so
08:40 if something happens to them you may not
08:42 have a software anymore here are a few
08:44 more AI tools to help you you can build
08:46 an app on Firebase you can use maxio for
08:49 billing and lastly you can use full
08:52 story for Behavioral data what is the
08:54 best way to keep customers happy make
08:57 sure to provide ongoing customer support
08:59 always always keep your software up to
09:01 date and iron out any bugs in the system
09:03 you want to make sure your product is
09:05 actually solving your customer's problem
09:06 you will also want to Monitor and
09:08 respond to customer feedback the goal is
09:10 to keep people on the platform for as
09:12 long as you can we always want to be
09:14 thinking about the future of our
09:16 business you want to make sure that your
09:17 processes are scalable so here are some
09:20 ways you can scale your business the
09:22 whole point of scaling is doing more of
09:24 what is working so use something called
09:26 the 8020 rule the 8020 rule states that
09:29 80% of your results come from 20% of
09:32 what you do and 20% of your results come
09:35 from 80% of what you do so narrow down
09:37 what's actually working for you and do
09:39 more of it for example if you're getting
09:41 most of your customers from ads put more
09:43 money into pushing ads if most of your
09:46 revenue is coming from Paid feature
09:47 upgrades build more of those for
09:49 customers to buy you get the gist here
09:51 are a few standard things you can do to
09:53 scale once you have customer data refine
09:56 your Target customer and retarget them
09:58 with ads you can also upsell your
10:00 customers solve the problems they face
10:02 before during and after using your
10:05 products and then charge them for it you
10:07 want to expand your market and start
10:09 selling to new locations or even adapt
10:11 your product to meet the needs of
10:13 adjacent Industries you can also build a
10:15 sales team around your product or even
10:18 automate your current processes another
10:20 thing you can do is raise additional
10:22 funding to pour into your business but
10:25 most importantly pour your money into
10:27 the places where money is already
10:28 pouring out for you now I want to hear
10:30 from you guys what SAS products are you
10:33 currently excited about comment them
10:35 down below look no one is going to
10:37 become an entrepreneur without facing
10:39 some challenges these are the common
10:41 challenges you will likely face in the
10:43 SAS industry but you've got this guys
10:45 Rome was not built in a day okay first
10:48 is churn rates a churn rate is the
10:50 percentage of customers that stop using
10:52 your services within a given time frame
10:54 turn rate percent equals the total
10:56 number of customers lost during a period
10:58 of time divided by total number of
11:00 customers at the start of the period and
11:02 then you times it by 100 you now have
11:04 your turn rate percent for example if a
11:07 company starts with a th000 customers at
11:08 the beginning of the month and loses 50
11:11 their turn rate is 5% just so you know
11:13 the typical SAS turn rate is 5% so if
11:17 customers are running away a little too
11:19 fast and you have a higher turn rate
11:21 make sure to check in on what might be
11:23 causing it and improve those areas you
11:25 can also run a survey to ask people why
11:28 they left competition there will always
11:30 be competitors in the ring but that's
11:32 kind of what makes life fun it's a
11:34 challenge other competitors May lower
11:36 their prices steal your features and
11:38 improve on them or even steal your
11:40 customers so pay attention to what your
11:42 customers are asking for and always keep
11:44 your features up to date this way you
11:46 can stand out in a saturated Market
11:48 let's talk about the future of SAS there
11:51 are a lot of new trends in the SAS space
11:53 the biggest one we all know of is AI but
11:56 there's a lot of other cool products
11:57 like data as a service platform as a
11:60 service and Market consolidation big
12:03 companies are actually acquiring smaller
12:05 companies in their space so it could be
12:07 a good strategy to build a SAS company
12:09 and then sell it to a bigger player
12:11 another trend is micro SAS companies
12:13 these are operating on a much smaller
12:15 scale the last one I will mention is
12:17 white label SAS this is where you can
12:19 purchase unbranded SAS software and just
12:22 put your brand on it anybody can become
12:24 a successful entrepreneur it is not the
12:26 smartest people in the room who do it
12:28 but just the ones who believe even
12:30 themselves enough are willing to learn
12:31 and take action you now know how to
12:34 start a SAS company a little Pro tip
12:37 before you go the biggest thing you can
12:39 work on as an entrepreneur is your
12:41 mindset everything you do stems from
12:43 your belief system so make sure you're
12:45 feeding your brain with thought food
12:47 that fuels your entrepreneurial Journey
12:49 it will not be easy you're probably
12:51 going to be challenged more than you
12:53 ever have been but there's a quote that
12:55 I really resonate with being an
12:57 entrepreneur means doing the known work
12:59 for the unknown outcome you don't know
13:01 what your results will be until you try
13:04 but the best thing you can do is take
13:06 action and do the work you know what you
13:07 need to do the other most important
13:09 thing is speed make sure you're taking
13:11 action quickly ideas can ruminate in our
13:14 heads for years and never make it out of
13:16 our minds so go get out there and build
13:18 a killer sass product I cannot wait to
13:21 see what you guys create I'm Chris
