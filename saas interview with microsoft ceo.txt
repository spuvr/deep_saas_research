00:00 the energy usage they're thinking is
00:02 going to pretty significantly affect our
00:05 planet and agents need more of it than
00:08 any workload previously but it's at a
00:11 different unit of scale. What are you
00:12 most excited about when the cost of
00:14 intelligence approaches zero? You know
00:17 right now to tame either inflation or
00:19 improve economic growth we need some
00:21 help. Do you ever see a future in which
00:24 the operating system is similar where
00:26 there's maybe no or very little
00:28 underlying traditional code? Every layer
00:31 of the tech stack has to be reimagined.
00:34 You had previously said the software the
00:37 application layer is going to collapse
00:39 down into agents. And what what does
00:41 that mean for vertical SAS companies?
00:44 All right, Satia, thanks for chatting
00:46 with me. Uh congratulations on
00:48 everything you announced at Build. Um,
00:51 yeah, I had a few questions. You've
00:53 overseen very successful major
00:56 transitions at Microsoft Cloud, the
00:58 adoption of open-source, and now we're
01:00 kind of in this this next one. With the
01:04 rise of these incredibly powerful AI
01:06 agents, how are you thinking about
01:09 investing in that while also maintaining
01:12 your kind of the current product suite
01:13 that you have and the major changes that
01:15 are coming to it? Yeah. First of all,
01:17 thanks so much for uh being at uh our
01:19 developer conference. You know, the way
01:21 I think about it is um first you have to
01:25 embrace what's new, right? And that's
01:26 where I think even you know now that
01:29 we're even two to three years in
01:31 depending on how you count into this you
01:33 know AI era and this agenting web era
01:36 the patterns of what it means to build
01:39 agents build apps is becoming clearer
01:42 right so you have to really go look at
01:45 the tech stack uh that you have uh that
01:48 you built maybe for a previous workload
01:51 um now needs to be really thought up
01:54 from first principles for the new
01:56 workload right so take even the
01:58 infrastructure layer right obviously
01:60 we're very very proud of the fact that
02:01 we have 70 regions of Azure all around
02:05 the world and then you say wow we now
02:07 need to retrofit them or fit them uh to
02:10 become AI factories right that's kind of
02:12 what you need to do turns out that if
02:15 you take even an app like chat GPT or
02:17 copilot uh it definitely needs a lot of
02:20 GPUs or AI accelerators but it also
02:22 needs everything else it needs in fact
02:24 tons of storage uh both in during
02:27 training and inference. It needs a ton
02:29 of compute, regular compute, not AI
02:31 accelerated compute, in order to be able
02:33 to for example have the environments for
02:36 agents. So, interestingly enough, it
02:38 turns out what we built over the last 15
02:41 years may be more relevant now because
02:44 agents need more of it than any workload
02:47 previously, but it's at a different unit
02:49 of scale. So, that's kind of what we
02:52 have to do at the infra layer. Same
02:53 thing with data, right? take data and
02:55 you say well you know data has been
02:57 always about take a database you said
02:59 that's where you schematize people
03:01 places things but now you can bring the
03:04 intelligence layer to the data right a
03:07 reasoning engine straight in like one of
03:09 the coolest demos we showed was this
03:11 Postgress which you know so modular that
03:14 you can now mix and match in your SQL
03:16 query an LLM response right I mean think
03:18 about the query plan you can generate so
03:21 I feel that every layer of the tech
03:25 stack has to be re-imagined but it also
03:28 means we can take some of the best work
03:30 we've done over the last 15 years and
03:32 have it compound for our developers uh
03:35 so that they can get the benefits of it.
03:37 So that's how we're thinking about it
03:39 right which is how do we make sure uh we
03:42 think about every layer of the tech
03:43 stack in from a first principles
03:45 perspective for the new AI workloads
03:47 that are being built uh and then really
03:49 stitch it together so that it meets the
03:51 real world needs of customers. Yeah. So
03:53 the the end users especially for
03:55 products that people are so familiar
03:57 with office 365 these products I assume
03:60 are going to be changing so rapidly. So
04:02 what what is that acceleration change in
04:04 the Yeah, it's a fascinating thing,
04:05 right? If I look at Office, right? There
04:07 are I'd say three modes of Microsoft
04:11 365. The first is the brand new mode
04:14 which is I have this new UI for AI which
04:17 literally is this new scaffolding uh
04:20 which has chat which has uh search which
04:24 has notebooks which is a place where I
04:26 collect all these heterogeneous
04:28 collections of data and do things like
04:31 podcasts and audio overviews and all of
04:33 that. Uh I have agents right like these
04:36 researcher and uh analysts. So these are
04:39 things that I can delegate tasks to and
04:42 so on. It's so exciting to have all of
04:43 that and I even have the copilot studio.
04:45 So in other words, I can build agents,
04:47 right? So that's the new thing which is,
04:49 you know, like I now have an UI for AI
04:52 and agents. Here's the other interesting
04:54 thing. Teams takes all of that into
04:57 multiplayer mode, right? All of those
04:59 agents are available to me in my channel
05:02 in my meeting, right? So teams becomes
05:04 the scaffolding in which all of the AI
05:06 now is working with me in multiplayer
05:09 mode. And the third mode is my heads
05:12 down just like how in GitHub copilot
05:14 with VS Code I'm heads down coding away
05:17 but I have agents that I can use. I'm
05:20 heads down on an Excel spreadsheet and I
05:22 have you know my copilot chat right
05:24 there. Right? That is like having a data
05:26 scientist next to me while I'm analyzing
05:28 a spreadsheet. while I'm research
05:31 writing a document I have a researcher
05:33 right there the idea is we've turned
05:36 every office canvas into an IDE with
05:38 chat essentially if you think about it
05:40 that way so in some sense I feel like
05:44 the value of even the M365 system now
05:47 has gotten to be more compounded uh
05:51 because of intelligence getting built
05:53 into all of these layers so I I I want
05:55 to continue on that note a little bit
05:57 you had previously said the software the
05:60 application layer is going to collapse
06:01 down into agents and I made a video
06:04 about it called it SAS is dead it you
06:06 know garnered a lot of attention um that
06:09 was really cool thoughts about it but I
06:11 want to hear you know the assertion is
06:13 there's going to be the agent layer and
06:15 then under that there's going to be the
06:17 grounded database that the agents can
06:19 read and write from and what what does
06:21 that mean for vertical SAS companies
06:24 what what how do they prepare themselves
06:26 for this future yeah like all of us I
06:28 think the the the the the way to go
06:30 about it. I mean, even the demo we
06:31 showed today, right? Literally, there
06:33 was Dynamics 365 uh with essentially an
06:36 MCP uh server that was used by Copilot
06:41 Studio to orchestrate a multi- aent
06:44 application that spanned CRM and many
06:48 other systems of record uh and then
06:51 completed essentially the orchestration
06:53 of a complex business process, right?
06:55 That seems to be here and now, right? I
06:57 mean it's kind of clear as day that when
07:00 you go about thinking about business
07:02 process and business applications you
07:04 have to compose yourself into something
07:06 like that. Uh and so yeah that will mean
07:09 pretty radical change if you all you
07:11 thought was hey I'm the system of record
07:13 or system of engagement or what have you
07:15 and it's just uh about workflows on top
07:18 of my data and that's the scope that's
07:21 just not going to persist. So I think we
07:22 have to all be open to participating in
07:26 what is this new orchestration layer in
07:29 the agentic web that will be essentially
07:32 will have multiple backends right your
07:34 SAS application will be one backend uh
07:37 you better support something like MCP uh
07:40 in order to be able to participate in
07:41 the agentic web uh and then maybe even
07:44 something like NL web could even reduce
07:46 the friction of all these connectors
07:48 right because if you think about
07:49 enterprises you know you have a
07:51 significant ificant sort of friction in
07:53 how connectors work. Something like NL
07:55 web could be massive change even inside
07:57 the enterprise. And so I feel like yes,
08:00 I think SAS applications we built may
08:02 have to radically change in order to
08:04 adapt themselves for this future. Yeah.
08:07 And so these these uh let's just say
08:10 these SAS companies, do you think
08:11 they're going to be curators of this
08:13 ground truth data for their customers
08:15 and then the agents will be provided by
08:17 platform companies like Microsoft? Yeah,
08:19 I mean I sort of think about like it's
08:21 unclear to me exactly how it all shakes
08:23 out because in some sense all of us
08:26 overstate the importance of one thing
08:27 that we have today but the reality is
08:29 when these platform shifts the value
08:31 will anyway get created somewhere else
08:33 right so this is where uh you know like
08:36 at the end of the day what's the job to
08:38 be done the job to be done is to
08:40 complete a business process it's not
08:42 about any one system of record and its
08:44 curation uh or it's not about any one
08:47 agent or one workflow It's about the
08:50 entirety of it, right? So that to me is
08:52 where the water is flowing and the
08:55 question is how do you flow with it
08:57 versus thinking that somehow I have this
08:59 moat and I'm going to hold on to it or
09:02 I'm going to build some sort of facade
09:04 around it which has an agent head or
09:07 what have you, but it's not the
09:09 comprehensive view of what the customer
09:11 in this case needs to, you know, get
09:13 done. Yeah, I really like that you said,
09:16 you know, different uh types of agents
09:17 are going to be talking together.
09:19 Different databases, it doesn't really
09:20 matter. It's just an abstraction layer.
09:22 Um, so that that all sounds really
09:24 exciting. Another thing you mentioned,
09:26 you had said in an interview that when
09:28 you hire somebody and an employee,
09:31 you're hiring them in the future uh and
09:33 their basket of agents, which is
09:35 fascinating to me. But I wanted to get
09:37 some clarity on that because it seems
09:39 like most likely the company the
09:41 employer is going to want to own that IP
09:44 the agents just like they would own
09:45 traditional IP. So maybe you can add
09:47 some clarity. Actually that's that's
09:49 correct. In fact uh what you said is
09:51 sort of our view right if I look at even
09:53 today's announcements because what is
09:55 the uh intellectual property of a
09:58 company right uh even the work product
10:01 of any one of us at work is the
10:03 company's property and so that I think
10:05 is going to be the case even with agents
10:07 and that's one of the fundamental
10:08 reasons why we extended the rails right
10:12 where you now agents have an entry id uh
10:15 you can manage conditional access uh for
10:19 uh these agents uh just like you do with
10:22 uh people inside of an organization
10:25 perview right another super important
10:26 thing if agents are going to have access
10:29 to data it needs to be subject to the
10:31 same data protection and data rights and
10:34 so we are going to abs and security by
10:36 the way you're going to manage the agent
10:38 environment like an endpoint uh so
10:40 that's why defender uh is going to make
10:42 sure that there is no credential theft
10:44 or what have you so absolutely thinking
10:46 of all of the things we've done from
10:48 identity management and security for
10:50 people and their IT infrastructure is
10:53 going to be done for agents and their IT
10:55 infrastructure. Yeah, you know that
10:57 makes a lot of sense and I also suspect
10:59 a lot of people are going to build their
11:00 own personal agents for their personal
11:02 life and maybe do you see a future in
11:04 which they are also bringing those
11:06 personal agents into work and it's a
11:08 great question. I mean the the system
11:10 where you bring your own personal agents
11:13 right uh has to be done in such a way
11:16 that these two worlds don't have the
11:18 data leakage right so that's the issue
11:20 right which is you know let's even take
11:22 the simple thing which is hey my email
11:24 and my corporate email uh today they're
11:26 two segregated things they're two
11:28 identities and we know how to separate
11:30 state out uh for both privacy reasons
11:34 and for also intellectual property
11:35 reasons right both of those are helpful
11:38 I think something like that that's why
11:40 even uh we believe in Entra and
11:43 Microsoft account right so that's why we
11:45 have copilot and Microsoft 365 copilot
11:48 conflating the two even in terms of the
11:51 user model uh is can be very confusing
11:54 the reason why I pin uh edge with two
11:57 profiles is helpful because I do it with
11:59 Microsoft account when I as a as a user
12:02 as an as an individual and I do this
12:04 with entra when I'm working uh at
12:06 Microsoft and it's a helpful
12:08 demarcation to keep this you know the
12:11 metal model simple otherwise I think by
12:14 conflating it all I think you can really
12:16 get up very tangled I think that makes a
12:18 lot of sense so I I want to ask you
12:20 maybe a a question about your vision so
12:22 the cost of intelligence does seem to be
12:24 dropping rapidly hopefully approaching
12:27 zero I think it's going to be such a
12:28 fascinating world in the future what do
12:30 you think um what use cases do you think
12:32 are going to open up what are you most
12:34 excited about when the cost of
12:36 intelligence approaches is zero. Yeah. I
12:39 mean to me ultimately right when I look
12:41 out there in the world uh do we need
12:45 more abundance of something like
12:47 technology like uh intelligence that can
12:50 then ultimately drive productivity and
12:53 economic growth. Absolutely right. I
12:55 look around and say man you know right
12:58 now to tame either inflation or improve
13:01 economic growth we need some help like
13:03 so this is you know high time. So if you
13:06 sort of take that thing and take sort of
13:08 the example we even shared at our
13:09 developer conference as to what Stanford
13:11 medicine was able to do for something
13:13 really high stakes right like you know
13:15 tumor board meetings and oncology and
13:18 cancer care they were able to take all
13:20 this technology and apply it in a real
13:23 way where they were it was a multi-agent
13:26 framework they used in foundry to
13:28 orchestrate you know pathology clinical
13:31 trials problemat data ultimately to have
13:34 a better tumor board meeting and then
13:36 have the data and the information from
13:38 that go into PowerPoint into a teaching
13:41 class or into teams for people to
13:43 collaborate. That is to me what needs to
13:47 happen. Healthcare is 20% of our GDP
13:49 close to a lot of the expense is in this
13:52 workflow. Uh and so if you know every
13:55 provider out there can start improving
13:57 their patient care and outcomes and
14:00 reducing cost using AI that's going to
14:03 have a profound impact in our societies.
14:05 Uh and so that's what I'm really looking
14:07 forward to. Yeah, I think the healthcare
14:09 use cases I'm I'm extremely excited
14:11 about hyperpersonalized healthcare. I
14:13 already used uh Chad GBT co-pilot to
14:16 answer questions about my own personal
14:18 health. It is very very exciting and
14:20 also some of the research uh that you
14:23 showed off the uh immersion cooling.
14:26 Yeah. Right. That was discover
14:28 discovered. Yeah. It's so cool. Material
14:30 science. There's there's just so much
14:32 there. Um, so, uh, anecdotally I've
14:35 heard from some of the younger
14:36 generation that they're either avoiding
14:39 AI altogether or or maybe just using it
14:41 lightly and and specifically because the
14:44 energy usage they're thinking is going
14:46 to pretty significantly uh, negatively
14:48 affect our planet and so so how how do
14:52 you how does Microsoft think about that?
14:53 What words of of confidence would you
14:55 give to them? Yeah, it's a first of all,
14:57 you know, the fact that the younger
14:59 generation cares about this deeply is so
15:02 so inspiring quite frankly because at
15:04 some level um it is sort of the right
15:07 push for all of us to be able to say
15:09 okay whatever we're creating is
15:12 fundamentally helping with these
15:14 outcomes that matter to us in society,
15:16 right? Whether it's in healthcare,
15:18 whether it's in education, whether it's
15:19 access to financial services, whatever
15:21 the domain is, ultimately it's economic
15:23 growth, it's economic prosperity and
15:25 abundance. So let's take that as the
15:27 first thing which is we're not doing
15:29 this just for some tech accomplishment,
15:30 but we're doing it to solve the
15:33 challenges of people and planet. Then
15:35 the second part is also important, which
15:37 is we've got to do it in a sustainable
15:40 way, right? It's sustainable abundance.
15:42 Um and and then if that is the case then
15:46 one of the equations I go back to is
15:48 it's tokens per dollar per watt right
15:51 the the fact that we are able to use
15:55 software right as the most malleable
15:58 resource to use energy in the most
16:01 efficient way to generate the most
16:04 amount of abundance which in turn then
16:06 improves health and education and other
16:08 outcomes is a good thing. uh and we just
16:11 have to stay on it, right? The the
16:13 reality is all of tech is what 2% 3% of
16:16 sort of the grid power today or total
16:18 power consumption. So it's minor but yes
16:20 it'll double uh and so if it if it needs
16:24 to double it needs to have the social
16:26 permission to double uh it needs to
16:29 create a lot more value in the real
16:31 world. In fact that's one of the reasons
16:33 why I feel like we as a tech industry
16:35 need to be anchored on not just one
16:37 product of ours that everybody's using.
16:40 uh for doing fun things. It has to be in
16:43 health care, in material science, in
16:46 broad knowledge work in a small business
16:49 getting productivity, right? Because
16:51 that's what'll give us the social
16:52 permission to continue to use the scarce
16:55 resource called energy. Do that with in
16:58 a sustainable way. We have some of the
16:59 biggest buyers of alternative energy. Uh
17:02 in fact, you could say the greatest
17:03 subsidy out there for new projects is
17:06 from, you know, people like us. uh we
17:09 really want to make sure we continue to
17:11 push on it but you know ultimately
17:13 deliver tokens per dollar a watt such
17:15 that it creates economic prosperity. I'm
17:18 glad you said that. I'm going to tell
17:19 the folks who are very nervous about the
17:21 environmental impact what you said and
17:22 I'll show them this video. So thank you.
17:24 Um there there's there's definitely a
17:27 major shift in computing architecture
17:29 happening right now. The the line
17:31 between deterministic and
17:32 non-deterministic parts of the
17:34 architecture are kind of getting
17:36 blurred. Um, I saw this really cool demo
17:38 a few months ago where they recreated
17:40 the game Doom using a diffusion model.
17:42 Every single frame was predicted. Do you
17:44 ever see a future in which the operating
17:47 system is similar where there's there's
17:49 maybe no or very little underlying
17:52 traditional code? Yeah, it's a great
17:55 like we had a similar one like this muse
17:57 model that we built was a world action
17:60 model that we had built but we trained
18:01 it on train you know on gaming data and
18:03 you know it starts to do essentially you
18:05 can have an Xbox controller as actions
18:07 that are then used to generate the next
18:09 scene which is sort of pretty pretty
18:11 it's kind of like robotics you can think
18:13 of is like that and gaming is like that
18:15 and so yes everything is uh generated so
18:18 to speak. um the operating system, you
18:22 know, to me this idea
18:25 that you know sometimes I think we even
18:29 overstate the determinism of what we
18:31 call deterministic systems right because
18:33 after all you take a software program
18:36 you can't prove it right I mean that's
18:39 sort of one of the fundamental
18:40 challenges of computer science that uh
18:42 it's um and so therefore I think we yes
18:46 it's a stochastic system but this
18:48 stochastic system does need to work in
18:51 deterministic ways uh that we can at
18:53 least like you know inspect quite
18:56 frankly what Elon said in the keynote
18:58 when I interviewed him he said hey we
18:59 got to understand the physics of
19:01 intelligence is actually a good way to
19:03 think about it right which is we have to
19:04 somehow get back to a place where when
19:07 we stitch these complex systems there is
19:09 some way for us to understand the
19:12 physics of these complex systems uh and
19:15 then bound them right sandbox them and
19:18 what have Right? I think that that's
19:19 what we will have to do even on an
19:20 operating system. But you when I look
19:22 back at it, you take the coding agent
19:24 that we just launched. Interestingly
19:26 enough, the coding agent has an
19:27 environment uh underneath GitHub
19:29 actions. You're really putting a virtual
19:31 machine and then you're really setting
19:33 the boundaries of that virtual machine,
19:34 right? Which is, hey, does it have
19:36 internet access or not? You have to
19:37 control it. If it's going to have access
19:39 to tools with MCP uh servers, you have
19:42 to control it. Uh and then there's a
19:44 full audit log of all of that. Um and so
19:47 I think that that's how we will learn
19:49 how to essentially mix a deterministic
19:52 system so to speak which a software
19:54 system that we built with a lot of
19:56 imperative code and you know uh and this
19:58 agent uh to couple together and then
20:02 have the interaction itself be something
20:04 that we can monitor. Yeah. I um so so
20:08 that it's really cool because you said
20:09 in the keynote we're kind of beginning
20:11 the middle innings of this transition.
20:14 So I really think uh it's a really
20:16 interesting time to see where that blend
20:18 of different types of software go. Thank
20:20 you so much for meeting with me. I
20:21 appreciate it. Thank you so much. Such a
20:22 pleasure. Thanks for coming and spending
20:24 the time and look forward to being in
