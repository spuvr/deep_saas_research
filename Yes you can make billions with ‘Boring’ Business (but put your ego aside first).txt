00:00 Warren Buffett didn't build Tesla
00:02 Facebook Google or Microsoft in fact he
00:05 himself told in an interview he missed
00:07 some of these great technological
00:09 Investments those are the big big
00:12 mistakes he didn't build any of these
00:13 world's largest companies and yet became
00:16 one of the wealthiest men on the planet
00:18 Warren Buffett discovered something else
00:21 but first he had to put his ego aside
00:24 and then he found the underestimated
00:26 power of boring businesses which this
00:29 whole video and see how worm Buffett and
00:31 people like him make billions starting
00:34 or investing in boring businesses when I
00:38 say boring businesses I am talking about
00:40 companies that rarely make headlines
00:42 businesses like the storage facilities
00:44 stretch collections or even renting
00:47 portable toilets these are everyday
00:49 products and services we all depend on
00:51 but they're not the kind of thing that
00:53 you will brag about to your friends at
00:55 the party they don't have a cool Cutting
00:57 Edge household name CEO like Steve Jobs
00:60 yet they make steady cash day in and day
01:02 out and for some reason people think
01:05 something like an sandpaper manufacturer
01:07 or parking lot owner does not have this
01:10 huge exponential tail at the end and
01:12 that is simply not true Warren Buffett
01:14 and even companies like 3M Amazon Costco
01:17 and many other businesses like Kohler Co
01:19 that you've never heard of are a great
01:21 example of that the Kohler family owners
01:24 of kohar Co built a massive wealth
01:26 manufacturing something as simple as
01:28 toilets kohar Co over the decades Grew
01:32 From manufacturing farm tools to
01:33 manufacturing a wide range of products
01:36 most famously toilets and sinks the
01:38 cohar family amassed A multi-billion
01:41 dollar Fortune by focusing on a product
01:43 that many people take for granted and
01:45 boring businesses don't only have to be
01:47 products they could be Services too self
01:50 storage facilities parking lots or
01:52 garages commercial cleaning services
01:55 pest controls Waste Management portable
01:57 toilet rentals car washes or roadside
01:60 assistant all of these businesses have
02:02 something in common it's not very hard
02:04 to recognize them I usually use a
02:06 four-step rule to spot a boring business
02:09 first is people won't get recognized for
02:12 doing that second it's hard to get
02:14 motivated to do it third it's easy to
02:16 predict demand and price and fourth the
02:19 businesses will be here 10 years from
02:21 now the source of their solid business
02:23 Foundation comes from the extreme High
02:25 utility they provide most of these
02:27 businesses run on a thin margin and are
02:29 very efficient let's take Warehouse
02:31 business for many people it is quite
02:33 inexpensive to use a warehouse it
02:36 usually has a good price per square foot
02:39 and convenient location and from a
02:41 business perspective minimum maintenance
02:44 cost and once the storage facility is
02:46 built it requires very little upkeep no
02:48 expensive labor force no inventory and
02:51 no Hightech equipment that needs
02:53 constant upgrades the beauty of the
02:55 warehouse business is that the world is
02:57 producing more and more things so people
02:59 have more things to store and that will
03:01 probably always be true therefore it is
03:04 very useful business and you will always
03:06 find someone willing to pay reasonable
03:08 money for that service in contrast for
03:10 example to risky startup trying to spot
03:12 the next big Trend boring businesses
03:15 thrive on reliability and necessity once
03:18 you understand this you will start to
03:20 see opportunities everywhere none of
03:22 them are popular but all of them
03:24 generate money so why is that that you
03:27 can make so much more money with boring
03:30 businesses the following is also the
03:32 main reason why they are the most
03:35 underestimated businesses when we look
03:37 at the business like a storage center
03:39 what separates them from the other
03:41 businesses is that the storage center
03:43 will be here for a very long time and
03:45 require minimum maintenance and since it
03:48 doesn't require maintenance they focus
03:50 on building out even more storage this
03:53 has very simple but profound result the
03:55 business itself is compounding so if the
03:58 financial situation allows it they just
04:01 keep building more and more storage what
04:03 is genius about it is that the prices
04:05 rise with inflation so the value of the
04:07 business at least on the paper increases
04:10 every year there is a big big contrast
04:12 to businesses that are trendy on social
04:14 media often pushed by social influencers
04:17 that never ran a business for example
04:19 marketing agencies products of marketing
04:22 agencies are not Timeless like the story
04:24 Center and maintenance of their clients
04:27 is extremely high none of the marketing
04:29 agen clients are guaranteed for the next
04:32 year none of the campaigns that they
04:34 create regardless of how genius they are
04:36 are likely never to be used again
04:39 agencies also need to educate themselves
04:42 to keep the agency relevant so maybe the
04:45 margins are high but there's nothing
04:47 that compounds and I have worked in
04:49 marketing for the past 20 years so trust
04:51 me I should know the maintenance of the
04:53 marketing agency is so timec consuming
04:56 that they don't have time to find new
04:57 clients so the business is not
04:59 compounding and us usually they reach a
05:01 specific size and then they are left
05:03 treading the water and I'm not saying
05:05 you can't make a solid business running
05:07 marketing agency but compounding this
05:09 business is extremely difficult and if
05:12 you watch some of my videos you know
05:14 that compounding is the key element of
05:17 exponential growth and there is a reason
05:19 why Warren Buffett loves boring
05:21 businesses they aren't just profitable
05:24 they compound over time a great example
05:26 of how compounding works is the Snowball
05:29 Effect think about rolling a small
05:31 snowball at the top of a hill at first
05:34 it's just a tiny lump of snow but as it
05:37 rolls it pick up more snow getting
05:39 bigger and bigger on its own by the time
05:42 it reaches the bottom it's way bigger
05:44 five times 10 times or 20 times bigger
05:47 that's exactly how compounding Works in
05:49 business and investing the longer you
05:52 let it roll the bigger it grows and the
05:54 bigger the ball at the start the bigger
05:57 at the bottom without needing extra
06:00 effort the key is patience and time
06:03 think of self storage facility you build
06:06 one it makes steady money you reinvest
06:08 the profits into another and then
06:11 another and soon you are making more
06:13 money without doing more work because
06:15 your past Investments keep growing on
06:17 their own this is how boring businesses
06:20 quietly compound into really big
06:22 businesses what is the weirdest thing
06:24 about boring businesses is that people
06:26 would choose the safe path to become
06:27 rich every time yet they go and gamble
06:30 their way into some speculative business
06:32 models someone talked about on YouTube
06:34 people are drawn to gambling to risk it
06:37 all we ignore the easy consistent
06:39 guaranteed business because it doesn't
06:41 feed our ego our ego prevents us from
06:44 working hard on boring projects and
06:47 becoming wealthy and deep inside we know
06:49 boring business is easy consistent money
06:53 so why are we in pursuit of making
06:56 extreme products like iPhones Instagram
06:58 Louis Vuitton handbags and Teslas why do
07:01 we want to create a trend driven product
07:03 like fashionable handbags rather than
07:05 plain white t-shirts that will always
07:08 find its customers now think about this
07:10 deeply and answer this question honestly
07:13 if I could guarantee you right now you
07:15 would make a million dollar a year you
07:17 would have to give up everything you are
07:19 doing right now and you would go and
07:22 start a mobile toilet business would you
07:25 do it would you give up right now all
07:28 the projects ideas that you you have
07:30 planned for this year or the next year
07:33 and you would go and buy five mobile
07:35 toilets and start lending them and I
07:37 would guarantee you that after 10 years
07:39 of hard work you would make a million
07:41 dollar every year and I don't know why
07:43 but I bet your brain goes immediately
07:46 defensive probably thinking about that
07:48 other thing that you had on your mind
07:50 for already some time so then you come
07:52 back to the idea of mobile toilets and
07:54 you think well I mean not mobile toilets
07:57 maybe something little bit different
07:59 well why why not people need it there's
08:01 a demand you only need one or two mobile
08:04 toilets to start and you can scale it to
08:06 hundreds of toilets what is it in your
08:08 brain that doesn't like about this
08:10 business well our brain doesn't want us
08:13 to be associated with toilets because it
08:15 doesn't give us social status in other
08:18 words our ego is on our way but aren't
08:22 we in it for the money money gives us a
08:25 social status is it then that the brain
08:27 refuses to see the potential of that
08:29 business business we all want to invent
08:31 things like Tesla SpaceX open AI Nike
08:34 and apple and become not only rich but
08:36 also respected by our friends this has
08:39 probably nothing to do with logic this
08:42 is our ego trying to convince us to
08:44 gamble everything into one speculative
08:46 project the same way we as kids want to
08:48 be astronauts dreaming of walking on the
08:50 moon and being the hero of every
08:52 conversation later most people find out
08:55 that working in the office will pay the
08:57 bills just fine we idolized
08:60 extraordinary we seek stories of
09:02 Visionaries who change their Industries
09:04 Elon Musk launching rockets and Steve
09:07 Jobs unveiling the iPhone but somewhere
09:09 along the way we overlooked the boring
09:11 businesses that quietly built billion
09:13 dollar Empires while staying under the
09:16 radar and it turns out you don't need to
09:18 invent a spaceship or build the next AI
09:20 model to create a massive wealth in fact
09:23 some of the most lucrative businesses
09:24 are so boring that they've never made it
09:27 into a publishing media Outlet think
09:29 about it parking lots literally just
09:31 empty spaces can generate millions in
09:34 income self storage facilities where
09:36 people pay monthly to keep junk that
09:38 they were barely use in their lives have
09:40 revenues that would make Tech startups
09:42 jealous and I know people deep down on
09:44 this I made a video about 3M and this
09:47 video got
09:48 120,000 views companies like 3M now
09:51 generate billions by selling scent paper
09:53 tape and posted notes products so
09:55 ordinary that you would never think
09:57 about who makes them and people deep
09:59 down know that that people who Wasted
10:01 Years of their life chasing the next
10:03 cool thing and I know it because I'm one
10:06 of them I think what is actually smart
10:08 to do if you are not an experienced
10:10 businessman is to take a step back and
10:13 see if building a boring business is not
10:15 actually the smartest business strategy
10:17 of all while the world is obsessed with
10:20 the next Innovative startup you can
10:22 focus on providing utility for a great
10:24 price and compound watch the video about
10:26 3M next to get the sense of how
10:28 underestimated are companies that build
10:30 boring products like sandpaper
