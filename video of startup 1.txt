00:00 I prompted my way to $30,000 without
00:03 writing a single line of code. This guy
00:05 made $30,000 from an app he built on his
00:08 morning commute. How? Two tools, Cursor
00:11 and Bolt. I think a lot of people make
00:13 cool stuff with Bolt and Cursor
00:14 nowadays, but they don't monetize it
00:16 because they need In this video, we'll
00:18 go over the wild story of how Polus just
00:21 built, launched, and marketed a SAS
00:23 product by himself and got traction in
00:26 about 30 days. you probably have like a
00:28 winning idea already that you could just
00:30 prompt your way and start building. Why
00:32 you should definitely tune into this
00:33 video? Well, I had Polus share with me
00:36 his exact process on screen of how he
00:39 builds fast with AI tools, how he
00:41 creates beautiful designs and how you
00:43 can too. And how making money and
00:46 marketing your app is as simple as a
00:48 couple tweets. All right, let's get into
00:50 it. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter
00:52 Story.
00:56 Welcome, Polus, to the channel. Thanks
00:58 for coming on. Tell me, what's your
00:59 story? My name is Polus and I used AI to
01:02 build an app that made me 30K. It's an
01:04 app that matches startups with
01:05 influencers and I built and launched it
01:08 7 months ago. It's got over a,000 users
01:10 at the moment with over 350 paid users.
01:13 I used Bolt and Cursor to make it and I
01:16 use Framer for design. I did it all
01:18 myself without needing a team all in my
01:20 daily commute. Nice. Cool. Before you
01:23 made 30K with your app, tell me a little
01:25 bit more about your background, your
01:27 story as an entrepreneur. It started
01:28 when I was 18 and I needed to make money
01:31 to get my way through college and the
01:33 only job that I could get was door to
01:36 door sales and one day I ended up
01:39 knocking on the wrong door and someone
01:40 literally grabbed me and held a knife to
01:42 my throat. After that, I just had enough
01:46 and I wasn't really employable as a
01:48 student. So, I dove into every side
01:50 hustle that I could. So I did web
01:51 design, I did copywriting, sales
01:54 funnels. I became kind of like a
01:56 generalist. It paid enough to get my way
01:59 through university. When I was in
02:00 university, I did computer game
02:02 development. But funny story, I actually
02:04 completely sucked at code. I was very
02:06 visual and I just couldn't understand
02:08 it. But now AI can actually code for
02:11 you. And so the limitations that I had
02:13 before are kind of removed. AI can do
02:15 the heavy lifting in terms of code and
02:17 kind of patch up the area where I'm not
02:19 the best at. Nice. So tell me what got
02:22 you into building online and and
02:24 realizing that you could, you know, make
02:25 money online. So I was going through
02:27 kind of a rough patch because I tried
02:30 all these different business models and
02:31 I wasn't making enough money to break
02:34 free from a 9 to5. I got really
02:36 frustrated one day that none of the
02:38 things that I did really got me where I
02:40 wanted to be. So I was pursuing
02:42 creatorled services and products just
02:44 work with creators and the idea of a
02:46 database came to my mind and I just
02:49 started building it out because it's
02:51 something I'd use myself and I figured
02:53 with AI I could turn this into a
02:56 fullyfledged SAS if enough people wanted
02:57 it. So I really just gave it a spin as
02:59 kind of like experiments and it did
03:02 pretty good. So tell me what it felt
03:03 like to finally launch and have this
03:05 validated idea and have it make its
03:07 first dollar. Tell me about that. So for
03:10 months before launch, I was building
03:12 this database. It was a lot of effort
03:15 and I had no idea it would pay off. So
03:18 when I launched my application, I
03:19 remember I was sitting with my
03:20 girlfriend and we were just having
03:21 dinner. I pull up my phone. I just see
03:23 sale after sale. I was like, "Okay, how
03:25 long is this going to keep going for?"
03:26 And that night got about like 20 or 30
03:29 different sales. So it was very nice
03:31 feeling that just motivated me to just
03:33 keep going and pursue this further cuz
03:35 now I felt like that was a validation
03:37 that this could be a real product. Okay.
03:39 So can you share your step-by-step
03:41 playbook on how you build MVPs with AI?
03:44 If I'm a complete beginner, I would
03:46 recommend everyone to use Perplexity.
03:48 It's what I did. I just asked Perplexity
03:50 because it has the most upto-ate
03:52 information. So it has all the
03:54 documentation, anything that you want to
03:56 any tool, any library, just tell it
03:58 you're a complete noob and absolutely
03:60 don't know how to do anything and it'll
04:01 give you really detailed step by step
04:03 because it's deep research. It'll pull
04:05 up a long document that you can
04:07 reference and just follow along. The
04:09 next step is I'd pull up Bolt and just
04:11 take it one step at a time as well. So I
04:13 would implement the first thing that
04:15 Replexity says. So it could be like the
04:17 dashboard, importing the project,
04:19 cloning a GitHub repository if there is.
04:21 Once I'm in there, I just keep prompting
04:23 it and if there's errors, I just throw
04:25 the error back at the AI. It fixes the
04:27 error, go onto the next thing, and I use
04:30 Bolt to a point where I get a nice
04:33 looking MVP with the functionality. And
04:36 then I take that, download the project,
04:37 I put it into cursor. And here is where
04:41 I hook up like superbase. So it writes
04:43 all the scripts to connect the back end.
04:46 and I get clerk off and that makes it
04:49 very simple to plug and play the
04:52 authentication. And this is all steps
04:54 that perplexity can provide for you. So
04:56 you can just ask questions along the way
04:58 and it'll give you some solutions.
04:59 Replexi is a great starting point. Bolt
05:01 is a great way to make the MVP and then
05:04 you move to cursor to dial in the
05:06 details. So you're 80% of the way there
05:09 and cursor will then just get you to the
05:12 final finish line. have users
05:13 authenticating. You have a backend with
05:15 real data and with a bit of prompting
05:18 and some scoring, it'll make it secure
05:20 as well. Okay, Polus is proof that it's
05:22 never been easier or faster to build an
05:25 app in 2025. Tools like Cursor and GPT4
05:29 make it possible to go from idea to
05:31 product in a weekend. But if you don't
05:33 understand your customer or what they're
05:35 searching for and how they describe
05:36 their problems, then you're just
05:38 building fast in the wrong direction.
05:40 That's why we're excited to partner with
05:42 Seamrush for this video. It's one of the
05:45 best tools out there for figuring out
05:46 what people actually want. You can plug
05:48 in an idea and see what people are
05:51 searching for, what's getting traffic,
05:52 and where the gaps are. It's got 26
05:55 billion plus keywords across 140
05:58 countries. And yeah, most people think
06:00 that it's just an SEO tool, but trust
06:02 me, it's way more than that. You can use
06:04 it to validate your idea before you
06:06 build, find high intent keywords your
06:08 competitors are ignoring, or even spin
06:10 up landing pages that match what people
06:12 are already looking for. I'm going to
06:13 show you how you can find successful
06:15 business ideas just like Polus is in
06:17 Semrush with one search right now. Go to
06:20 Seamrush and find their topic research
06:22 tool. Search any topic or niche. Let's
06:25 just do Tik Tok influencer since that's
06:27 kind of similar to Polus' business, but
06:28 you could literally just search
06:29 anything. And I'm going to open some of
06:31 the cards that look interesting like
06:32 this one. Tik Tok influencer marketing.
06:35 On here, you can see all the questions
06:36 people are literally plugging into
06:38 search engines. These are the real
06:40 problems people have and are actively
06:42 looking for a solution. I like this one
06:44 because it's not a super high keyword
06:46 difficulty and there's high volume of
06:47 people searching for it. So maybe
06:49 there's some lowhanging fruit in there.
06:51 And look right here, Tik Tok influencer
06:54 search platform. What's the best way to
06:56 hire Tik Tok influencers? Polus'
06:58 business can literally be tied back to a
07:01 single page in Seamrush. And that's just
07:04 crazy powerful if you ask me. Right now,
07:06 they're offering a free 7-day trial to
07:08 try out all 55 tools in the platform.
07:11 Just head to the first link in the
07:12 description if you want to try it out.
07:14 All right, let's get back to it. We
07:16 talked about the code building an MVP.
07:18 Let's talk about one thing that I think
07:19 is really cool about your stuff is how
07:21 good it looks. How do you use AI to
07:24 design amazing looking websites? It's
07:26 really the simplest it can be. First
07:28 thing I do is I pull up Framer and I
07:30 pick a free template. So any template
07:32 that you see on there that you like.
07:34 It's simple enough and clean for you to
07:35 edit. And then you just have to pick a
07:37 nice font and a nice button. And then
07:39 the rest just needs to be simple and
07:41 clean. The most important part is just
07:43 to get out. Focus on just editing the
07:45 template really quick and just put it
07:47 out there. Cool. Based on what you built
07:49 and what you've learned working on lots
07:51 of marketing stuff and also on your own,
07:53 what do you think is like the most
07:54 important thing to focus on when you're
07:56 creating a good landing page and a good
07:58 design? So, I focus 80% of my time on
08:00 everything that's above the fold. We'd
08:02 call this the hero section. This the
08:04 first thing that people see when they
08:05 open the website and has to have the
08:08 your full message just out there and
08:10 people really need to grab an
08:12 understanding of what it is within the
08:14 first couple seconds. Anything that you
08:15 can save them time with, save them
08:17 money. Anything that solves a painful
08:19 problem, you should have in a headline
08:21 and a subheading, and then just a big
08:23 call to action. All right, so we talked
08:25 about landing page design, which was
08:26 awesome, but what about UI design? When
08:29 you're building an app, how do you use
08:30 AI to design UI and UX? When I'm
08:33 building it out in cursor, you get the
08:35 basic thing done and then you add some
08:37 things to it. So, the more features you
08:39 add, the more things you work on, it's
08:41 got to stay clean. and it's got to stay
08:42 cohesive and you got to make sense. So
08:45 for everything UI related, I just ask it
08:48 to make it clean, functional, and
08:50 modern. And I try to have it use like
08:52 shad CN components and they're all free.
08:54 But when I have ideas and when you have
08:56 ideas for how you want onboarding flow
08:58 to be or some other elements of the app,
08:60 what I would suggest is just creating
09:02 something in Figma, you can doodle if
09:04 you want. You just plug it into cursor
09:06 and just explain the behavior that you
09:08 want and then it'll spit out a nice
09:10 looking page for you. All right. Well,
09:12 thanks for sharing that. Let's dive into
09:15 the marketing side of things cuz uh
09:17 seems like X Twitter has really been
09:19 working well for you. Tell me about that
09:21 strategy. Show me a tweet that really
09:23 took off for you and and let's talk
09:24 about that. So, this post did the most
09:27 in terms of numbers. It got close to
09:28 500k impressions. And I think the reason
09:31 it worked is because I found an angle to
09:35 attach it to trends happening in the
09:37 space. A lot of people when they're
09:38 building in public never go viral
09:40 because they never join the bigger
09:42 conversation and human attention span is
09:44 limited. So it's 100 times easier to
09:47 just bring your ideas to where the focus
09:48 is already happening. So this post had
09:51 you know nice simple visual demo has
09:53 like real like raw human like reaction
09:56 but most importantly it tapped into the
09:58 main debate at the time which was is AI
10:00 coding actually good enough to build a
10:02 full SAS. Thanks for sharing that. I'd
10:04 love if you just shared a little bit
10:05 more about the bigger strategy here the
10:07 bigger thing which is build in public. I
10:09 love if you just talked about that from
10:10 you know kind of strategy perspective or
10:12 what you love about building in public
10:13 and why it's worked for you. So for me
10:15 what's worked is just shipping often.
10:17 don't just have like one big video
10:18 release like a lot of VC startups. So,
10:21 for example, I tapped into the
10:22 influencer conversation that was
10:24 happening at the time. I saw Mark Lou
10:26 posting a similar format. So, I figured
10:28 I'd get some inspiration and then
10:31 convert it into a post for Creator
10:33 Hunter. What's not worked for me and
10:35 what I see is there's been like a lot of
10:38 competitors and copycats that come up,
10:39 but they never really take off because
10:41 either they're copying the exact same
10:43 thing and people see right through that
10:45 and you need an edge that no one can
10:47 easily copy with AI tools nowadays.
10:50 Nice. That's a good strategy. Okay, so
10:53 now the exciting part. Let's talk about
10:55 tech stack. What tools, languages, or
10:57 whatever else you use to build this
10:59 business? And if you don't mind me
11:00 asking, what are the generally the costs
11:02 to run this business? What kind of
11:04 margins are we looking at? I use
11:05 perplexity for the game plan, bold for
11:07 the functional MVP, cursor for making it
11:09 production ready. I use Versal which is
11:11 free and then Superbase also free and
11:13 then API for scraping. In terms of costs
11:15 and margins, so it's about 90%. All
11:18 right. So what I want to ask you is, you
11:20 know, you you built a bunch of stuff and
11:22 you finally seeing success with Creator
11:24 Hunter. What have you learned during
11:25 that process that surprised you? I'm
11:27 getting a lot of questions as well about
11:29 how I did it and people want the sauce
11:32 on how to build stuff and build stuff
11:33 fast. I think you can just start
11:35 prompting and just prompt your way to
11:37 making something and sell it. I think
11:39 people underestimate the knowledge they
11:41 already have. So like if you have like a
11:42 deep domain knowledge, you probably have
11:44 like tons of ideas already on what to
11:46 build and you probably have like a
11:48 winning idea already that you could just
11:50 prompt your way and start building. I
11:52 like that. Cool. All right. Now that you
11:54 are working on this full-time, tell me
11:55 what a day in the life looks like for
11:57 you for now building Creator Hunter.
11:58 Yeah, so it's a big change. More
11:60 traveling and more work. When I was
12:02 building out the MVP and was at the same
12:04 time traveling to China, New York,
12:06 France, and seeing revenue while you're
12:09 out and about exploring is a nice
12:11 feeling. It's a real blessing. But I've
12:12 been working on it full-time on Creator
12:14 Hunter since the 24th of December when I
12:16 quit the job. So some days there's more
12:19 hours that I put in this than my 9 to5.
12:22 But I don't feel exhausted at all. Cool.
12:24 I like that. Well, the last question
12:25 that we asked anybody that comes on
12:27 starter story is if you could give
12:28 advice to young polus maybe a couple
12:30 years ago. What would you tell them? I
12:32 think never underestimate how much you
12:35 can do solo. AI as your CTO is like a
12:38 superpower. I I don't know how long this
12:40 period of time will last, but we need to
12:42 take advantage of it. Whatever ideas you
12:43 have, you can probably execute it in a
12:45 weekend. If you just figure out the most
12:47 scrappy idea possible in the most
12:49 scrappy way possible, you can get it out
12:50 there. And then if you put a buy button
12:52 on it, share it on Twitter in the most
12:54 scrappy way or Tik Tok, I think you'll
12:56 be surprised by the amount of people
12:57 that actually want to get it. Well,
12:59 that's great advice. Thanks for coming
13:00 on, Polus. I love what you built. You're
13:02 going to be a massive success. Keep
13:04 building, keep going, and uh hopefully
13:06 we'll see you back on the channel. Thank
13:08 you. Thanks, Polus, for coming on. I
13:11 think his story is amazing and it's
13:12 proof that anybody right now can build
13:14 anything with AI. I mean, he just got
13:16 started. He built a bunch of stuff and
13:18 throughout that process found the idea
13:20 that would change everything. I see a
13:22 lot of people waiting for the right time
13:24 to start and just sitting on the
13:26 sidelines while others like Polus are
13:29 just getting started playing around with
13:30 these tools, throwing at the wall
13:32 and shipping stuff every week. If you
13:34 got started right now and started
13:36 playing with these tools and shipping
13:37 stuff, imagine where you'd be in two
13:40 weeks. Yes, it's early and not
13:42 everything is perfect, but the early
13:43 bird gets the bag. So, if you're serious
13:46 about shipping, want to build something
13:47 real and put it out into the world,
13:49 check out Starter Story Build. I put the
13:51 first link in the description. Let's
13:52 build. Thanks for watching. I'll see you
13:54 guys in the next one. Peace.
