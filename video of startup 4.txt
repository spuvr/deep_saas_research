My Apps Make $4.5M/Year With $0 Marketing

00:00 my Shopify app Kaching Bundles is
00:02 currently making me $4.5 million a year
00:05 and we spend almost zero dollars on
00:07 marketing how does this guy make over $4
00:10 million a year without spending
00:11 thousands of dollars on marketing well
00:13 the answer is something you probably
00:15 wouldn't expect all of our growth is
00:17 coming either from or Eric started his
00:21 journey as a designer making just $2 an
00:24 hour then he stumbled onto an
00:26 opportunity that would change his life
00:27 forever i think there's still a lot of
00:29 opportunity building in platforms and
00:31 I'm personally researching i spent over
00:34 an hour talking to Aricos about all his
00:37 different Shopify apps and how anybody
00:39 can start building these things from
00:40 scratch and good news he shared
00:42 everything including how to find
00:44 platform specific ideas to build how to
00:47 run an async team with 90% margin and
00:50 the unique marketing strategy that
00:52 helped him grow to $4.5 million a year
00:55 in just two years all right let's get
00:57 into it i'm Pat Walls and this is
00:60 Starter
01:03 Story welcome Ericos welcome to the
01:05 channel tell me about who you are and
01:07 what business that you built hi guys so
01:10 my name is Ericas i'm from Lithuania
01:12 originally currently living in Paris and
01:15 I'm a designer turned entrepreneur
01:17 building Shopify apps together with my
01:20 co-founder and we're currently at 4.5
01:23 million annual recurring revenue what's
01:26 really cool about our business is that
01:28 we're 90% profitable okay if you could
01:31 give me a little bit of a breakdown of
01:34 apps that you built so currently we have
01:38 uh five apps in total our first app in
01:41 the discount category was Kaching
01:43 Bundles and we scaled it to around 400k
01:46 monthly recurring revenue currently uh
01:49 then we launched Kaching post purchase
01:50 upsell after that we launched Kaching
01:53 pop-up upsell and right now few weeks
01:55 ago we launched Kaching uh card drawer
01:58 upsell all of these apps are in the
02:00 discount category serving customers that
02:02 want to increase their average order
02:04 value within Shopify since our launch in
02:07 2022 August we already made more than
02:10 400 million in additional revenue for
02:13 all of the merchants that are using our
02:15 apps that's awesome in building these
02:17 businesses what have you learned what is
02:19 the big opportunity on building apps on
02:21 platforms the thing I noticed about the
02:24 app developers is that there's like solo
02:27 developers indie hackers and I thought
02:30 that they lack great user experience all
02:33 of their apps are kind of technical and
02:36 a bit complex for for regular users and
02:38 the other type of apps was VCbacked or
02:42 like huge corporations the user
02:44 experience were uh was great but the
02:46 problem about them was that they
02:49 actually move pretty slow if if there's
02:51 a feature lacking it would take probably
02:53 months or or maybe even a year to launch
02:56 something new so that's how I kind of
02:58 knew that there is an opportunity for me
03:01 to be in that ecosystem and to try to
03:03 beat all of those solid developers i
03:06 wasn't sure that I will be able to
03:08 compete with high bigger companies
03:10 backed up by VCs and so on like a year
03:13 or two years after doing Shopify apps I
03:15 realized that it's possible to compete
03:17 with them as well okay let's go a bit
03:20 into your backstory here what did you do
03:22 before entrepreneurship and what got you
03:24 into building stuff yeah so right after
03:27 finishing my school I joined a local web
03:30 design agency and I started working for
03:32 $2 per hour since day one I was always
03:36 thinking how can I 10x my earnings and
03:39 uh I quickly I realized that if I want
03:42 to earn more I have to work like for
03:44 myself i I I have to start freelancing
03:47 so that's what I did in 2016 or 2015 I
03:51 guess 3 to 4 years later while I was
03:53 still freelancing I was building
03:56 products on the side i had a client a
03:58 startup who needed a landing page so
04:01 what I was doing I was just browsing the
04:03 internet and looking for inspiration and
04:05 that's how I stumbled upon Shopify
04:09 partners page i bookmarked it and later
04:11 on when I looked into it I saw uh a
04:15 section which said that top 25% Shopify
04:19 app developers are making almost 300k a
04:22 year and in my eyes it was like oh my
04:25 god it's it's huge because what I was
04:27 making with my freelance work was was
04:29 much less having all of the experience
04:31 in Shopify I knew how how those apps
04:34 were and that's how I realized that I
04:36 have to build something myself in the
04:38 ecosystem cool okay the Shopify app
04:42 opportunity how did you find this idea
04:44 and generally how do you think about
04:45 finding ideas when I was thinking of
04:48 what do I want to build in the Shopify
04:50 app marketplace I I already had three
04:53 main criteria so first one was it has to
04:57 be pretty easy to build i have to build
04:59 it in like couple of months no more than
05:02 that the second criteria was pretty
05:04 broad market i wanted to build something
05:07 that could be useful for any Shopify
05:09 store because it would be a lot easier
05:12 to market it and I could use all of my
05:14 clients that use Shopify and so on the
05:17 first criteria was I needed low
05:20 competition so that's my main my main
05:22 setup how how I differentiate good ideas
05:26 versus bad ideas nice so on the topic of
05:29 uh good ideas and bad ideas let's talk
05:31 about validation how do you know when
05:33 your idea is validated and what has that
05:36 looked like for your apps before before
05:39 building it I tried to validate it with
05:42 basically talking to users you know I
05:44 joined various Discord communities of
05:47 drop shippers i joined e-commerce
05:50 Facebook groups i posted various
05:52 Facebook posts in in those groups and
05:55 one of the posts where I I had a
05:57 screenshot of my not yet published app
05:60 it was just a design and it kind of blew
06:02 up there was more than 100 likes and a
06:05 lot of comments asking you know where
06:07 can I don't download this app because
06:09 they thought that it's already live so
06:12 that was my first validation that this
06:14 product is needed and and yeah it it
06:17 could be successful if you can build a
06:19 landing page or something to try get uh
06:22 get the emails of your customers that's
06:24 great if you can even charge for it
06:27 maybe make a pre-order or something
06:29 that's that's even better because you
06:31 already know that people will pay money
06:33 for it all right I got to stop you real
06:35 quick and zoom out ericos built an
06:37 insane business 4 million a year on top
06:40 of the Shopify app store without
06:41 spending any money on ads and that's
06:44 maybe the secret building on top of a
06:47 marketplace you don't need a big
06:48 audience you don't need to spend money
06:50 on ads and there's a built-in customer
06:52 base just waiting for you to solve their
06:54 problems the only problem with that is
06:56 that Shopify's developer ecosystem is
06:59 I'll admit pretty mature in other words
07:02 that means there's a good amount of
07:03 competition on the platform so that begs
07:05 the question what's the next Shopify
07:07 what's the under the radar marketplace
07:09 where I think developers should be
07:11 building right now well one place I
07:13 think is interesting is the monday.com
07:16 marketplace we partnered with them on
07:18 this video because they're putting real
07:20 energy behind expanding the marketplace
07:22 investing in the platform supporting
07:24 developers and actively looking for more
07:27 builders to help meet their growing
07:29 customer demand now is the time to get
07:31 in early and make your mark while it's
07:34 still easier to stand out they've got
07:36 over 245,000 customers across over 200
07:40 industries and 90% of their enterprise
07:43 customers use monday.com apps enterprise
07:47 that's the big bucks what's also cool is
07:49 they have good APIs clean docs solid
07:52 SDKs and a team dedicated to helping you
07:55 grow and make money if this tickles your
07:57 fancy well with monday.com we put
07:60 together this free download breaking
08:02 down a bunch of stats about the
08:04 opportunity here who their users are and
08:06 what kind of problems they really need
08:08 solved and here's a pro tip take some of
08:11 that info and plug it into your favorite
08:13 LLM and I bet it will give you some
08:15 really cool ideas for what to build if
08:17 you want to download just click the
08:19 first link in the description fill out
08:21 the quick form and sign up for your
08:23 developer account it's all 100% free to
08:25 get started i'm stoked that we got to
08:27 partner with monday.com in this video
08:29 because Aeros is an example of what
08:31 happens when you build on a marketplace
08:34 all right let's get back to the
08:35 interview you're a designer not a
08:37 developer how do you go about actually
08:39 building these products what's your
08:40 process to go from zero to one with a
08:42 new idea yeah so when I'm when I'm
08:45 designing things the first thing I look
08:48 into is competitors if there's already
08:51 competitors in space uh that's a good
08:54 thing because you can dig into deeper
08:56 and and see how they do like see their
08:59 user experience just go through it and
09:02 I'm taking notes what I really like
09:04 about it and what I dislike about it and
09:07 after that I I have a clear image of how
09:11 my app could look like so that I could
09:14 fairly say that it's objectively better
09:17 than my competitors and to make uh my
09:21 chance for success higher I have to find
09:24 a co-founder i think finding a
09:26 co-founder is is pretty much similar to
09:29 doing sales because you have to sell
09:31 someone an idea that you can make a
09:34 successful business and you just need
09:36 their help that's what I was trying to
09:38 do you know I went into a local
09:41 developer group in Facebook i made a
09:43 huge post i and I mentioned that you
09:45 know first of all I have Shopify
09:48 experience second I'm a great designer
09:50 with years of experience so I can
09:52 provide a great user experience which
09:54 will increase our chance for success
09:57 third I have all of those clients
09:59 already using Shopify which we can sell
10:02 our Shopify app to and with all of those
10:04 things you know I think I'm increasing
10:06 my chance for for finding a right fit
10:10 and and that's basically h how I found
10:12 my co-founder let's go to the next
10:14 section here i want to talk about
10:15 marketing uh how do you go from Shopify
10:18 app to real users and real paying
10:20 customers when you are just a new app
10:23 you have zero users you have nothing
10:25 you're right at the bottom of the app
10:28 store listings so I knew that we need to
10:31 onboard as many users as we can manually
10:35 so yeah I just I just went to all of the
10:38 communities i just went to all of my
10:40 clients all of my friends that are using
10:42 Shopify and asked them to install our
10:45 app and try it for themselves i made the
10:47 app free and this way you can get more
10:50 installs and of course more installs
10:52 then convert to to more reviews and of
10:55 course it drives more revenue then and
10:57 it helps you know to improve your
10:59 product further because you get all of
11:01 this feedback okay I want to dive into
11:04 some of the dirty details about this
11:06 reviews thing because I think that this
11:08 is it's simple it sounds simple but it's
11:10 actually genius so let's go a little bit
11:13 deeper into the customer support and
11:15 review strategy that really did change
11:18 your business yeah so once we said that
11:21 it's crucial for us to get those
11:24 five-star reviews we optimized all of
11:26 our processes towards it so first of all
11:30 our product within our product you
11:32 straight away we just ask
11:39 for then we have all of these uh monthly
11:42 emails so every month we're sending a
11:45 monthly email in which we uh show how
11:48 much revenue this app brought to you and
11:51 in that email we also ask for review i
11:54 think around 95% of our reviews for for
11:58 our apps come from customer support our
12:01 customer support is is topnotch all of
12:03 our customer support agents are really
12:06 technical so they can dig into your code
12:08 and and fix things and yeah we provide
12:11 24/7 customer support right now nice and
12:15 now that you have a team you realize
12:17 still how important this is and I
12:19 realize that you have like a little bit
12:20 of a system that where you gamified
12:22 reviews can you talk more about that so
12:24 recently I introduced a gamified bonus
12:27 system to our customer support team and
12:30 right now we're tracking who gets uh
12:32 more reviews we have the monthly
12:35 leaderboard and uh we we have all of
12:37 these different raffles and actually my
12:40 favorite B bonus is uh a persuader of
12:43 the month and what we do is we basically
12:46 calculate the conversion rate of how
12:49 many uh times you ask for a review and
12:51 how many reviews you get and I think it
12:54 really helps uh those agents bring more
12:57 reviews and of course incentivizes them
12:59 because they get bonuses for for each
13:02 review cool okay okay well let's dive a
13:04 little bit into monetization pricing and
13:07 conversion how did you make the first
13:09 dollar with cashing apps and how did you
13:12 get those first users when we got our
13:14 initial reviews when we started ranking
13:17 for for specific keywords uh that's when
13:20 we introduced our monetization we
13:22 introduced a subscription model uh later
13:25 on we introduced some tiers so like the
13:28 more you use our product the the the
13:30 higher price you pay nice and is there a
13:34 kind of a strategy that you think about
13:35 now every time you go to launch a new
13:37 app I always launch it for free because
13:40 it reduces friction of installs and as
13:42 soon as I start getting organic installs
13:45 I grandfather all of the users that
13:47 already using uh our app so that they
13:49 wouldn't need to pay and I monetize only
13:52 the new users and yeah we always uh
13:56 offer free trial that that also helps
13:59 and we offer full refunds no question
14:01 asked because I think the risk of
14:04 getting onestar review is is is just is
14:07 just too big that that was awesome uh
14:10 next question is let's talk about tech
14:12 stack uh what kind of tools or languages
14:14 do you use to build and run this
14:16 business yeah so languages wise I I will
14:19 not tell much because I'm I'm not
14:21 technical but uh in our organization we
14:24 primarily use Slack for for our
14:26 communication then for our customer
14:28 support we use intercom then we use uh
14:31 features.vote for gathering feature uh
14:34 suggestions so every user can go to that
14:37 board and suggest a feature or just
14:39 upvote for other features that they
14:41 think that we need to implement another
14:43 tool that we're using is linear uh so we
14:46 we use it internally for our task
14:48 management last but not least we use
14:50 Mantle you have everything Shopify
14:53 related there you you can set up
14:55 affiliate partnerships uh you you can
14:57 see all of the metrics uh all of the
14:60 funnels uh customer management and so on
15:02 since day one our uh profitability was
15:05 around 90% expenses wise we we always
15:09 try to stay very very lean and and I
15:12 hope we will stay lean in the future as
15:14 well cool that's amazing let's move on
15:17 to the next question more the lifestyle
15:19 side of things can you give me what the
15:21 day in the life looks like for you a
15:23 Shopify app developer making millions of
15:25 dollars per year uh what does your
15:26 typical day look like yeah so I get up
15:30 whenever I get up i I don't set any
15:32 alarms uh I check my emails uh while
15:36 still in bed i I scroll some Twitter
15:38 like probably everyone else in the world
15:41 when I have my to-do list I always try
15:44 to diff differentiate like quick wins
15:47 something that I can do in like up to 30
15:49 minutes and all of the other stuff is is
15:52 is the harder stuff that that I focus on
15:54 later on i I love the lifestyle i I love
15:58 what I do and I don't feel like working
16:00 i I feel like I'm doing something i'm
16:03 really passionate about which which
16:05 really helps because I'm you know I'm
16:07 not counting time at all that's awesome
16:09 last question that we always ask uh all
16:11 founders on the starter story channel
16:13 what advice would you give to someone
16:15 looking to start their own business and
16:17 start their own thing online so I think
16:19 that at start two people are are enough
16:23 you just have a designer who does all
16:25 all of the product stuff you have a tech
16:27 guy and and you're good to go because
16:30 you will be doing all of the customer
16:32 support yourself to know that uh what
16:35 your clients are struggling with and
16:37 yeah once you start getting more tickets
16:39 and once you start growing and and and
16:41 scaling your product then you can start
16:44 hiring customer support and then you can
16:46 start you know scaling scaling your team
16:49 and uh yeah another ad- advice I I could
16:52 give is probably to hang around other
16:54 people that are building because uh you
16:57 know community is is really is really
16:59 helping because you you get to know
17:01 people you can learn from their mistakes
17:04 and uh yeah maybe you can even you know
17:07 find a co-founder in those communities
17:09 and and so on that's it thank you uh
17:12 Ericos for coming on the channel sharing
17:15 your business that makes millions 90%
17:17 profit margin is amazing and I can't
17:19 wait to see you hit 10 million and take
