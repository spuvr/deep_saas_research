00:00 all I've got to do is write a launch
00:02 email this is going to send to
00:06 4,588
00:07 people it's going it's the launch email
00:11 it's been over 12 hours so I'm going to
00:14 see whether anyone else has bought this
00:16 product 1 month ago I launched a SAS I
00:20 thought everything was in place to make
00:22 the project a
00:24 [Music]
00:27 success then this happened so I'm going
00:29 to see whether anyone else has bought
00:31 this product nobody else has that was an
00:35 experiment and sometimes your
00:36 experiments don't go as you expect in
00:39 this video I share how I picked a
00:41 product what marketing strategy I used
00:43 on launch day and what I've done since
00:46 then to try to salvage the situation
00:48 here's my failed SAS story follow along
00:51 to learn from my
00:52 mistakes if you made a $1,000 on your
00:55 next SAS launch how would that feel well
00:57 that was my success criteria for this
00:59 project and if I could reach it I would
01:01 get one step closer to earning an
01:04 independent income online so what was my
01:06 plan to make $1,000 well my idea was to
01:10 take a product that I'd seen someone
01:12 else launch successfully and put my own
01:14 spin on it you see a few months ago I
01:16 was thinking about a product made by
01:19 this Indie hacking influencer that for
01:21 him did phenomenally well it's what's
01:23 called a SAS bootstrap project a start a
01:27 project with payments login and lots of
01:29 other functions ality for you to add
01:31 your own custom Logic on top of so my
01:34 idea was to do something similar except
01:36 using my own Tech stack and automating a
01:39 lot more of the setup process to make it
01:41 as fast as possible for a developer to
01:43 begin building a web app I did a quick
01:45 calculation if I can sell the product
01:47 for $50 I'd only need 20 sales in order
01:50 to reach my $1,000 Target well that
01:53 would be easy I told myself I was
01:55 confident that I could reach people here
01:57 on YouTube so while I began building
01:59 this bootstrap project which I called
02:01 Dev Launchpad I put up a wait list and
02:04 linked to it in every single YouTube
02:06 video I published I figured that I'd
02:08 probably need to get about 200 people
02:10 onto that list if I could convert just
02:12 10% of those to buyers that would be the
02:15 20 sales I needed to reach my target so
02:18 as I developed my product and as launch
02:20 day approached more and more people got
02:23 added to my weit list and I had a
02:25 profound sense that I cracked this whole
02:27 online business thing well that wasn't
02:29 to be the case
02:31 1 month ago on the launch day I hadn't
02:34 reached my target of 200 people on my
02:36 weight list only 74 but here's the thing
02:39 I had over 4,000 other people on another
02:42 email list that I've been growing over
02:44 the years so as I drafted the launch
02:46 email and sent it out I was still
02:49 feeling pretty
02:50 confident woke up the next morning and
02:53 I've made one sale now don't get me
02:55 wrong one sale is better than no sales
02:58 but I realized at this rate I would
02:60 never reach my target there was
03:01 obviously something very wrong two
03:03 things immediately came to mind I'm not
03:05 getting enough eyeballs on my product or
03:08 my landing page just isn't converting
03:10 visitors to customers so over the next
03:13 few weeks I tried to fix what I thought
03:16 might be a landing page Problem by
03:18 adding tiered pricing which I had heard
03:20 before increases conversion that didn't
03:22 work so I decided to completely rewrite
03:25 my landing page using this template I
03:28 took from Dan Co by describing the
03:30 problem that the customer has the
03:32 transformation that I've experienced
03:34 myself and how my product could help
03:36 them achieve the same thing I was
03:38 confident that this V2 landing page
03:40 would start bringing in the sales but it
03:42 didn't solve the problem I even tried
03:44 changing the color scheme but nothing
03:46 seemed to work after all this work on
03:49 trying to improve the conversion of my
03:50 landing page I turned to increasing the
03:53 traffic every video I published onto
03:55 YouTube I added a link to my Dev
03:58 Launchpad and with over 40 videos I've
04:00 now driven 3,600 people to my landing
04:03 page and I have picked up a couple more
04:05 sales four sales total but that's still
04:08 only a 0.1% conversion rate at that
04:12 point I had to admit to myself that
04:14 maybe it's not a landing page problem
04:16 maybe it's not a traffic problem maybe
04:18 it's a problem with my product
04:20 itself having worked on this bootstrap
04:23 project for a couple of months now I
04:25 feel like this endless tweaking could go
04:27 on forever but for me personally the way
04:29 I learn best is by doing something again
04:31 and again and improving a little bit
04:33 every time so even though I've only made
04:36 $236 from this product these are three
04:39 valuable lessons I've learned that I'm
04:41 going to apply to the next one number
04:43 one solve a problem that somebody has
04:45 not you but somebody else that you've
04:47 got solid evidence that they actually
04:49 have a problem you can solve my Dev
04:52 Launchpad solved a problem because it
04:53 meant I saved time with all the setup
04:56 for a new web app launch but it was an
04:58 assumption that others would have that
04:60 problem too for my next web app I want
05:02 to validate there are at least three
05:04 people out there that have the problem
05:06 before I even write one line of code to
05:08 solve it following on from that number
05:10 two is to get customers in advance of
05:13 building the product I assumed that if I
05:15 could get people onto a weit List 10% of
05:17 them might buy but my actual conversion
05:20 rate was more like 1 and a half% if I
05:22 can get people to put cold hard cash
05:25 down for my product in advance that
05:27 signifies that they have the problem and
05:29 they see value in the solution that I'm
05:31 proposing number three is to get
05:33 feedback from somebody else on my
05:35 landing page the landing page is so
05:37 important because it's the main place
05:39 where you can communicate the value of
05:41 your product I've gone for this
05:43 particular angle which resonates with me
05:45 about learning to create an independent
05:47 income online but just because that's
05:49 meaningful for me doesn't mean it will
05:50 be for visitors to the site so for my
05:53 next project I want to find someone to
05:55 either help me craft the landing page or
05:57 at least review it and considering how
05:59 much payoff that could have I'd be
06:01 willing to pay someone to help me with
06:03 that so even though this SAS launch was
06:05 a flop I've still learned some valuable
06:06 nuggets of wisdom which is why rather
06:08 than feel demoralized I'm still feeling
06:11 motivated and a kind of Bring It On way
06:13 because I know if I can improve by just
06:15 one% after every failure all I need to
06:18 do is increase the number of times I
06:20 take a swing with the bat it's easy to
06:22 make the mistake of assuming that your
06:24 sass launch is always going to go to
06:26 plan but if you take the approach that
06:27 each one is a small experiment for you
06:30 to test what works and what doesn't work
06:32 then as long as you keep going success
06:34 is going to be inevitable see you in the
06:36 next one
