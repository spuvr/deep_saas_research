00:00 I officially sold my app for $200,000.
00:03 I got the money in my account,
00:05 This is me, back in July 2024
00:08 and this startup
00:09 I sold,
00:09 I created it in only one week
00:11 and worked on it for less than a year.
00:12 I documented the whole process
00:14 from the moment I got the idea,
00:15 found my first customers,
00:16 up to the final sale.
00:17 So if you’re ready
00:18 take a seat and let's go back in time.
00:20 Two years ago.
00:21 *VHS rewind noise*
00:23 So it's just me and my laptop.
00:30 After selling my
00:31 previous startup for $65,000,
00:33 I took some time off to rest.
00:35 The danger of running out of money
00:36 in the next few months was gone.
00:38 But since I sold
00:39 my main source of income.
00:41 I didn't have income anymore.
00:42 So I couldn't stay like that
00:43 and do nothing forever,
00:44 or I would run out of money eventually.
00:47 So it was time to get back to work.
00:48 To create a new source of income.
00:50 Now, you know the saying:
00:52 If something is not broken, don't fix it.
00:54 I just had to repeat exactly what I did
00:56 with my previous startup.
00:57 Find an idea,
00:58 build it quickly and make money.
01:02 My goal was to make a startup
01:03 I could grow mainly
01:04 using Facebook advertising.
01:06 Since I have seven years of experience
01:08 in advertising.
01:08 Oh but, Facebook is dead.
01:10 Only boomers use it
01:11 I don't even go there anymore.
01:21 Remember, it's not because
01:23 you do something that everyone does.
01:25 But why? Facebook ads?
01:26 Simple
01:27 ads on
01:27 Facebook can reach a massive audience
01:29 very quickly.
01:30 And unlike Google Ads where you are
01:32 limited by the number of people
01:33 looking for specific keywords.
01:35 Facebook ads
01:36 let you reach
01:37 pretty much anyone in the world.
01:39 But there is one crucial requirement
01:41 for this to work.
01:42 if the audience is too small,
01:43 or cannot clearly be identified.
01:45 Facebook might have a hard time
01:47 finding customers.
01:48 With that in mind,
01:49 it was just a matter
01:50 of finding the right *idea*.
01:51 / How do you pronounce idea? /
01:53 With that in mind,
01:53 it was just a matter
01:54 of finding the right idea.
01:60 I was trying to write something
02:01 on the Google Docs
02:02 when I noticed a transcription button.
02:04 So I tried it and.
02:08 Yep, that was shit.
02:09 I tried multiple times,
02:10 started to get frustrated,
02:12 and was ready to give up.
02:13 But then I realized.
02:15 surely I wasn't the only one
02:16 who was too lazy to type
02:18 and would prefer to speak instead.
02:19 Which means,
02:21 that could be a startup idea.
02:23 And perfect timing:
02:24 Some new AI models for audio
02:25 transcription were released
02:27 a few months earlier,
02:28 so I could just use that.
02:29 And even better,
02:30 this idea fits
02:31 all the criteria of a good startup idea.
02:33 It provides value
02:34 because it helps do something faster.
02:36 It has a large scale.
02:37 Everyone want to write faster.
02:38 I did have the technical skills to do it,
02:40 and I had this solution with ads.
02:42 So without waiting, I went to work.
02:45 I set myself a deadline of one week
02:46 to code the app. And after...
02:48 Oooh one week? it's impossible.
02:50 You need months to launch a startup.
02:51 You're my friend. Are wrong.
02:54 Now let's be real.
02:55 Failure is a norm in startups.
02:58 99% of
02:59 new startup fail.
03:03 So we are going to assume you idea.
03:05 As good as it is,
03:08 will fail.
03:09 Now, if you knew, you will fail.
03:11 Would you still spend
03:12 four months working on it?
03:16 When you launch a new startup,
03:17 there is only one thing that matters:
03:19 Figuring out as early as possible
03:21 if people would be willing to pay for it.
03:23 And having short deadlines...
03:27 ...forces you to focus on the essential.
03:29 until you have proof
03:30 that people
03:31 are willing to pay for your product.
03:36 Nothing else matters.
03:38 So make a first version
03:40 with only the essential features.
03:42 Then if it works, add more.
03:44 Or simply said, don't fix bugs
03:46 if there is no customers
03:47 to experience them.
03:49 So after a week of grinding,
03:51 I had my first version ready
03:53 and it was no time to find a name.
03:55 Its website to make notes by talking.
03:59 So I called it Talknotes.
04:01 Yeah. Creativity was never my strength.
04:04 Now I have a general rule
04:05 of never spending more than what
04:07 the project generates.
04:08 So paid ads
04:09 would have to wait a little bit
04:10 until I got revenue first.
04:12 But how can I generate
04:13 revenue without ads then?
04:15 Startup directories are websites
04:18 that showcases new startups.
04:19 People visiting
04:20 those websites
04:21 are what we call "early adopters".
04:23 They actively search
04:24 for new tech products
04:25 to try them before everyone else.
04:27 So when you have a new product
04:28 that's a bit innovative,
04:29 it's a great place to get started.
04:31 So I spent two hours
04:32 looking where
04:33 similar startups were listed
04:34 And added mine everywhere I could
04:36 And it worked.
04:37 I got a little bit of traffic
04:38 from those directories,
04:40 and even made $700 of sales
04:42 in a couple of days.
04:43 Sure, it's not a life changing amount,
04:45 but it was just enough
04:46 to show me this idea
04:47 potential and to focus all in.
04:49 However, after a few weeks,
04:51 the sales slowed down
04:52 and to the point
04:53 where they stopped completely.
04:55 So what happened?
04:57 Well, you see a launch is an event.
04:59 You will get a spike of traffic,
05:01 but eventually it will die down.
05:03 The only way to fix
05:04 this is to have a long term
05:06 distribution strategy like SEO, paid ads,
05:09 direct outreach, etc..
05:10 Or simply said, a way to get people
05:13 visiting your website every day.
05:14 Problem was,
05:15 the website was still not generating
05:17 enough revenue to reinvest in ads,
05:19 and I wasn't really good
05:20 with other distribution channels.
05:22 So guess what I did?
05:23 Well...
05:24 Truth is, I had no idea what to do.
05:27 And because of that, I got depressed
05:29 and almost completely
05:30 gave up on the project.
05:31 And I feel that's something
05:33 no one talks about on YouTube or online.
05:35 Sometimes it just sucks
05:37 and you will feel like shit.
05:38 And unfortunately,
05:40 that's just entrepreneurship.
05:41 Not everyone will make it.
05:44 At least one thing was clear.
05:45 If I wanted this project to go anywhere,
05:47 I had to figure out a way
05:49 to get consistent revenues.
05:50 The first thing I did
05:52 was to switch to a subscription model
05:54 where people pay every month
05:55 to access and use the app.
05:57 That would make revenue more predictable.
05:59 To find new users.
05:60 I tried different things.
06:01 Like ranking
06:01 higher on Google,
06:03 sending direct email
06:04 to the potential customers, and more.
06:06 While I got some result from it,
06:07 it was still very slow.
06:08 But, I had one card I didn't used yet,
06:11 and if you saw my previous video,
06:12 you can probably guess what it is.
06:15 Hey, Nico from the present here.
06:16 Because.
Yeah, I actually recorded this video
06:18 six months ago.
06:20 I just wanted to add a quick disclaimer.
06:22 I'm going to talk about product Hunt,
06:23 but lots of things
06:24 changed with ProductHunt
06:26 since this video was recorded.
06:28 To keep it simple,
06:29 You probably won't get featured
06:31 But you still get a backlink (for SEO),
06:33 so it's still worth it to launch there.
06:36 But you probably won't get featured
06:37 and get a big spike of traffic
06:39 and all that.
06:41 So yeah, just a quick disclaimer.
06:43 Yeah. That's it. Back to the video.
06:45 ProductHunt is a website
06:47 where new tech products compete
06:49 against each other
06:49 every day to get upvotes.
06:51 It's basically a startup directory,
06:53 except it got
06:54 millions of visitors per month
06:56 and lots of journalists
06:57 go there to write articles
06:58 about new tech products.
06:59 It's a great way
07:00 to bring a bit of revenue
07:02 and boost the morale on the short term,
07:04 which in return helps
07:05 you work on the project
07:06 for the long term.
07:07 So I listed my startup on Product Hunt.
07:09 Got lots of upvotes,
07:10 even got a “Product of the day” award
07:12 and got lots of traffic from that.
07:14 And thanks to the media coverage
07:15 after the launch,
07:16 the app quickly grow to $1500 of monthly
07:19 recurring subscriptions (MRR).
07:24 Since I now had some
07:25 predictable revenue,
07:27 I decided to start ads.
07:28 And even if the result
07:29 were not incredible at first,
07:31 I still managed to get a few sales
07:33 every day. The hardest was done.
07:34 My startup was generating
07:36 consistent revenue
07:37 every month, and I could
07:38 now try to scale it.
07:39 Now, growing
07:40 a startup is a lot of trial and error.
07:43 You need to try things,
07:44 see what works, and do more of that.
07:46 But that takes a lot of work and energy.
07:48 So I needed to focus.
07:50 And I had the perfect solution for that.
07:52 In May 2022,
07:53 I locked myself in a hotel room
07:55 for two months to learn how to code.
07:57 This is what I call monk mode.
07:59 The principle is simple.
08:00 Find a place comfortable enough
08:02 so you can stay inside for weeks.
08:04 Organize your routines
08:05 so you don't waste any time
08:06 and grind all day.
08:07 It's simple, but it worked for me.
08:09 I went from zero to be able to code
08:11 fully working websites
08:13 in just two months.
08:14 So it was time to do that again.
08:16 I found a nice apartment,
08:17 took from my savings
08:18 and paid six month upfront
08:20 And then prepared for the grind.
08:25 So right now,
08:26 my app is making $3000 of monthly
08:29 recurring revenue.
08:30 but I think I can do better than that.
08:32 I think I can push my app
08:34 to $5000 to $10,000 of monthly
08:37 recurring revenue
08:38 before selling it for a way better price.
08:42 So yeah, that's basically
08:44 what I'm going to try to achieve,
08:46 during those six months.
08:48 So I will do everything I can to grow my app,
08:53 it doesn't matter what it takes.
08:55 I'm just here.
08:56 I don't have any,
08:57 you know, anything else...
08:58 Just pure focus.
08:60 My girlfriend just left back to the US.
09:03 So we're going to spend,
09:05 long distance for some time.
09:08 So it's just me and my laptop.
09:10 The place I found
09:11 had the gym in the building.
09:12 And I found a healthy meal service
09:14 delivery nearby.
09:15 With this system in place,
09:16 I could optimize my routine to extreme
09:18 and never leave my building,
09:20 which is exactly what I needed.
09:21 At first,
09:22 it was hard to choose what to focus on
09:24 because there was
09:24 just so many things to do.
09:26 But after testing a few things,
09:27 I finally found the trick
09:29 that allowed me to double my revenues.
09:32 Imagine this.
09:33 You have an online store
09:35 that sells pet supplies.
09:36 Now you want to run ads to attract
09:38 new customers.
09:39 What's the best move?
09:40 Instead of making generic ads,
09:42 focus on a specific customer group.
09:44 For example, create
09:45 an ad specifically for Corgi owners.
09:48 you will reach less people,
09:50 but you can be sure that a Corgi owner
09:52 seeing an ad asking
09:53 “Are you a Corgi owner?” will read it.
09:56 Simply because it's made specifically for them,
09:58 and it's not generic,
09:59 which will generate more sales.
10:01 Quality over quantity.
10:02 So I decided to do that for my startup
10:04 and started making ads
10:06 and landing pages for specific audiences.
10:08 and after a few weeks of testing,
10:10 my website started to generate
10:11 more revenues. Way more revenues.
10:14 Between the revenue
10:15 made for the monthly subscriptions
10:16 and users who paid one year upfront.
10:18 I started to generate over
10:20 $10,000 of sales per month.
10:22 I even allowed myself
10:23 to take a small break in Korea
10:24 to meet friends.
10:25 Everything was great.
10:26 But have you ever heard of Murphy's Law?
10:31 Everything that can go
10:32 wrong will go wrong.
10:33 And the worst possible time.
10:39 On April 16.
10:40 In the middle of the night,
10:42 a bug happened on my website
10:44 and made it completely unusable.
10:45 And when I woke up.
10:47 I woke up
10:49 saw that the sales
10:52 were completely down 70%
10:55 because of the
10:57 fucking bug that slipped last night
11:01 when I was asleep.
11:02 And then there was another issue.
11:04 And then another one and another one.
11:06 And it just doesn't f**king stop,
11:11 the whole f**king day.
11:12 I spent seven hours
11:14 straight trying to fix ONE
11:16 bug and I could I just could not.
11:18 It was not working.
11:19 I don't want to deal with
11:20 this shit anymore.
11:22 I received over 50 emails
11:24 from customers complaining,
11:25 sales were down
11:26 70%, and people
11:28 started to cancel subscriptions.
11:30 It lasted for two days before
11:32 I was able to fix it, during
11:34 which I barely got any sleep.
11:35 But when I tried to get back to work,
11:38 something was wrong.
11:39 It's like my motivation was drained.
11:42 I couldn't do anything at all.
11:43 So I waited a few more days and waited
11:47 Until I realized I just cannot work on it
11:50 anymore.
11:51 I'm like, way to,
11:53 I don't know, burned out, I guess.
11:57 like, I can work
11:59 20 minutes and then I just,
12:01 I cannot just
12:02 too hard and I cannot focus on stuff.
12:06 it would take much longer to recover
12:08 from that
12:08 and be able
12:09 to work on this project again.
12:11 If ever.
12:11 But not working on it
12:13 for months was not an option.
12:15 The A.I. space moves incredibly fast
12:17 and in just one month,
12:19 you can become completely irrelevant.
12:21 So the two solutions
12:23 were to either hire someone
12:24 to manage a website for me,
12:26 or to sell it.
12:27 Hiring someone would allow me to take time off,
12:30 but finding the right person
12:32 would be another headache.
12:34 I didn't want to deal with.
12:35 So there was only one option: To sell it.
12:38 From my calculations,
12:40 my startup could be worth up to $300,000.
12:43 But there was an obvious problem.
12:50 I didn't had 6 to 10 months.
12:52 Due to the burnouts,
12:53 working on
12:54 this project was not an option.
12:56 and if I waited, it would eventually
12:57 stop growing and lose its value.
12:59 The conclusion was simple
13:01 I had to sell in the next two weeks,
13:02 or I could be left with nothing.
13:09 I got on a call
13:09 with Ebony from acquire,
13:11 who gave me tips
13:12 to get the best outcome
13:13 considering my situation.
13:14 So I decided to price
13:15 my startup at $200,000
13:17 to make sure it would be a good deal
13:19 for the buyer to get full cash
13:21 and to sell it fast.
13:22 I quickly got my first formal offer
13:24 for $200,000,
13:25 and the buyer was fine to pay cash.
13:27 And in the next few weeks.
13:29 And after a few weeks of waiting,
13:31 I received the asset purchase agreement
13:33 called APA.
13:35 So this is the purchase...
13:37 the Asset Purchase Agreement.
13:41 which means once this is signed,
13:43 the sale is done.
13:44 And it's not just about transferring
13:46 the actual things.
13:48 I don't know what to say,
13:49 I'm just really excited.
13:51 *click*
13:53 Okay.
13:53 This is done.
13:55 And just like that,
13:56 my startup was officially sold.
13:58 But it wasn't over.
13:59 We might have signed
14:00 a piece of virtual paper,
14:02 but I still had to transfer everything
14:04 and receive the $200,000.
14:06 Now, to make sure everything
14:07 would be transferred safely,
14:09 we decided to use a middleman: Escrow.com
14:12 And as you are able to see,
14:13 things would go terribly wrong.
14:15 So the buyer sent money to the,
14:18 like, middleman, to Escrow.
14:20 So now it's just about,
14:21 we transfer everything.
14:22 And so I'm going to, you know,
14:24 transfer them the domain name, the, like.
14:27 Yeah, everything basically,
14:28 which should be tomorrow.
14:31 And after that.
14:32 Yeah, the transaction is complete.
14:35 And I get my money.
14:37 So this is great.
14:40 It's 10 P.M,
14:43 and I just received a message from,
14:47 the middleman Escrow, who just said
14:49 that they did not wanted
14:51 to send me the money because I use Wise
14:55 but obviously, like, wise is literally,
14:59 their options, like, it's literally said.
15:01 Yeah, you can receive
15:02 your money from Wise
15:05 I'm not sure
15:05 if everything is
15:06 going to have to be canceled.
15:08 I don't know how it's going to work
15:10 because the buyer can only do
15:11 the transfer tomorrow.
15:12 After that, he won't be available
15:13 for, like, a long time.
15:14 This is fucking bullshit.
15:16 Like, I literally used Wise last time
15:19 using them,
15:19 so I don't know
15:21 if they're lying or whatever,
15:23 but they just don't want to send me
15:24 the money.
15:30 Apparently,
15:31 it's because I only had a Wise
15:32 account for this company.
15:34 And they don't accept Wise.
15:35 But their website clearly says
15:38 they accept Wise.
15:40 So I'm not really sure what happened.
15:42 Opening a new bank
15:43 account could take months.
15:44 So this was out of the equation.
15:46 And after trying to negotiate with them
15:48 and threaten them,
15:49 it was clear
15:50 We had to cancel everything
15:51 and restart from scratch.
15:53 This would take at least a few more weeks
15:55 for the buyer to get refunded.
15:56 And could potentially
15:58 read the whole thing
15:58 if the buyer just ran out of patience.
16:01 Luckily for me, the buyer
16:03 still wanted to continue the acquisition.
16:05 This time, instead of using a middleman,
16:07 we would do everything manually.
16:09 But even if I trusted the buyer,
16:11 there was still a risk.
16:12 He would not send me the money
16:13 after I transferred everything.
16:15 But I had no choice.
16:17 So I did it anyway.
16:18 The only thing left now was for the buyer
16:20 to get refunded by the middleman,
16:22 and then get my $200,000
16:24 after transferring everything.
16:25 But as you can probably guess,
16:27 by the time left in this video,
16:29 it didn't work as planned.
16:33 Hey.
16:33 So,
16:36 so it's been a week
16:39 now, waiting for the refund
16:40 from the middleman Escrow.
16:45 It's just.
16:46 It's just more and more
16:47 waiting, like, honestly,
16:49 like, mentally I feel depressed as fuck.
16:53 I probably said that
16:54 like, 20 times already, but.
16:55 Yeah, the
16:56 the waiting is f**king killing me.
16:57 I just hate that.
16:59 I'm not going to say, you know, it's hard
17:00 because it's not like
17:01 I was working in a factory
17:03 or something like,
17:05 like manual work, but it just
17:07 it just pisses me off.
17:08 Just really pisses me off.
17:09 But, apparently
17:11 the buyers received the refund back,
17:15 so it means that
17:18 it's like early next week...
17:20 We should be able to finalize everything.
17:23 Turns out Escrow
17:25 lied about the refund
17:28 so the money never reached my buyer's
17:31 bank account.
17:31 They lied.
17:32 They said it was sent.
17:34 It was processed.
17:36 but no, it's not.
17:38 My buyer contacted his bank.
17:40 The bank said no,
17:41 we didn't receive anything,
17:42 so they are f**king lying.
17:44 And after contacting them
17:45 and threatening them
17:46 for almost two weeks,
17:48 we had the refund done.
17:49 Now that the buyer had the money back.
17:51 It was time to transfer everything.
17:53 And again things started to go wrong.
17:55 so yeah,
17:56 we need to find a way to transfer Stripe.
17:58 And of course, the supports
18:00 have absolutely no
18:01 f**king clue how to do it.
18:04 we called them.
18:06 The person was like, oh,
18:07 yeah, I don't know how that works.
18:09 So that's great.
18:11 So we need a special team,
18:13 which obviously take a week to answer.
18:15 The most critical
18:16 part of the transfer was stripe,
18:17 the platform
18:18 to handle monthly subscriptions.
18:20 But there was no easy way
18:21 to transfer subscriptions
18:23 from one account to the other,
18:24 So we would have to delay more.
18:26 But luckily the buyer found a startup
18:28 that could do it.
18:29 It costed him $3,000
18:31 for one hour of work from them,
18:33 but it worked.
18:33 And it saved us day of manual work,
18:35 so it was worth it at the end.
18:37 With the transfer done,
18:39 the only thing left
18:40 was to receive
18:41 my $200,000 on my bank account.
18:43 And guess what?
18:46 All right,
18:48 all right.
18:49 So finally,
18:51 I officially sold my app for $200,000.
18:54 I got the money on my account,
18:56 So, yeah,
18:56 I hope you will be able to see it,
18:58 but yeah, 200,000 minus
18:60 some of the bank fee.
19:01 The money just came in.
19:03 I was going to bed like right before.
19:05 Okay.
I'm going to just turn off the light,
19:07 go to sleep
19:07 I just checked
19:08 I refreshed in the morning was
19:10 it was here so.
19:12 Oh my God, that's fucking surrealistic.
19:17 I don't know.
19:17 I'm not very good
19:18 at expressing stuff,
19:19 but I'm really fucking happy.
19:22 I can retire in Asia if I wanted to.
19:25 Like, I can live in Bali or in Thailand
19:28 or anywhere for,
19:29 like, forever, basically.
19:31 of course there will be some taxes
19:33 and stuff like that,
19:33 but the amount is still super high
19:36 compared to what I'm used to.
19:38 Oh fucking
19:39 hell, this is insane.
19:44 yeah,
19:46 I actually, I don't know what to say.
19:48 I'm just really happy.
19:50 I'm really happy
19:51 that this is finally done.
19:52 I'm really happy that I can move on.
19:54 With this acquisition,
19:55 plus the sales
19:56 I made from my other projects.
19:57 now have around
19:58 $300,000 in my (company's) bank accounts,
20:00 which is 30% of being a millionaire.
20:03 Nice,
20:03 I might still be burned out,
20:05 but at least I have a shitload of money
20:07 on my bank account now.
20:08 That is before coming back to work
20:09 because I just sold
20:11 my main source of income again.
20:12 But spoilers
20:13 I already have a new startup
20:14 that generates revenue already.
20:15 And this is
20:16 because I have a good process
20:17 to find new startup ideas.
20:19 And if you want to know how,
