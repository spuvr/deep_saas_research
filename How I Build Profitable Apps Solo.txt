00:00 most developers never make any money
00:02 from the things they build and it's
00:04 usually not because the code isn't good
00:05 enough it's because the idea wasn't
00:07 focused the problem wasn't clear the
00:09 execution lacked direction or maybe too
00:12 much time was spent on trying to learn
00:13 too much when I first started I'd build
00:16 cool features with zero idea who it was
00:19 for no marketing no monetization plan
00:22 but profitable apps don't just happen
00:25 they're the result of being intentional
00:27 having a plan solving a real problem and
00:29 learning the things you need to know
00:31 fast so if your goal is to build apps
00:33 that provide value and earn money then
00:35 this video will help to break down
00:37 exactly how I approach building
00:39 profitable solo projects the mindset you
00:41 need how to define success how to build
00:44 market and iterate in a lean way and
00:46 I'll share the exact tools and tactics I
00:48 use to help me move faster and smarter
00:51 let's get into it
00:53 so let's talk about mindset before you
00:55 write any code shift your identity from
00:58 just a developer to a problem solver
01:01 that's the biggest mindset shift that
01:02 separates hobbybuilders from those who
01:04 create profitable apps you're not just
01:07 writing code or relying on AI for your
01:10 solutions but instead you're
01:11 understanding and solving real problems
01:13 for your users that means staying
01:15 curious talking to users and the truth
01:17 is people will pay good money if you can
01:19 resolve a pain point save them time or
01:21 even help them make more money another
01:24 big shift let go of perfection if you're
01:27 waiting until it's polished you're
01:28 already too late profitable builders
01:31 ship early get feedback and improve
01:33 quickly small wins stack up finally
01:36 treat every project like a learning
01:37 opportunity if you consistently provide
01:40 genuine value you will stand out as
01:42 someone who can solve real problems
01:46 so many projects fail before they even
01:48 start not because they're bad ideas but
01:50 because the goals were vague build a
01:52 cool app isn't a goal you need to
01:54 provide this goal with more information
01:56 for example I want to build an app that
01:58 does X to solve Y problem for these
02:01 users you need to define three things
02:03 clearly who it's for what problem you're
02:06 solving and what success looks like is
02:08 it revenue retention feedback or better
02:10 yet build something that solves your
02:12 problem just like I did with Fast
02:14 Folders if it helps you it will help
02:15 other people whether you build an MVP or
02:19 an SLC it doesn't matter just make sure
02:21 at launch it can complete the main task
02:23 that it's made for you want to ship a
02:26 version one of something complete not a
02:28 version 0.1 of something complex and
02:31 don't forget constraints give yourself a
02:33 deadline a scope limit a focus it's so
02:36 easy to overbuild i find that tighter
02:38 goals actually unlock more creativity
02:40 because they keep me honest and
02:43 moving now the fun part building to code
02:46 your own app you'll need to pick a tech
02:48 stack but don't overthink it choose one
02:50 that fits your strengths and your
02:52 project goals if you're unsure where to
02:54 begin check out
02:56 roadmap.sh it's an excellent free
02:58 resource that lays out learning paths
03:00 for front end backend databases and more
03:04 it's actively maintained and helps you
03:05 focus on what matters without getting
03:07 lost in the weeds once you're ready to
03:10 build start lean my MVP is always the
03:13 simplest version that solves one real
03:16 problem i avoid distractions like user
03:19 authentication or fancy animations those
03:21 come later but even with minimal
03:23 features your app should feel intuitive
03:26 that's where design makes a huge
03:27 difference i'm not a designer but I
03:29 still want my projects to feel polished
03:31 and that's where Mobin comes in mobin is
03:34 a massive library of realworld UI
03:36 patterns from the best apps out there
03:38 like Stripe Notion and Linear so if I'm
03:42 building an onboarding flow a setting
03:44 screen or even just a login page I can
03:46 instantly see what great design looks
03:48 like and apply it it helps me build
03:50 better UI faster and it's especially
03:53 valuable if you're a solo dev without a
03:55 design background there's a link below
03:57 if you want to check it out
04:01 one of the biggest productivity unlocks
04:03 for me has been picking the right tools
04:05 these days being a solo developer
04:07 doesn't mean doing everything alone i
04:08 treat tools like teammates first off I
04:11 use VS Code and Cursor as my go-to idees
04:14 cursor especially has been a gamecher
04:16 lately it brings AI right into the
04:18 editor helping me debug refactor and
04:21 even generate code without switching
04:23 tabs but use these tools wisely for fast
04:27 UI prototyping I've been using Versel's
04:29 V0 you can describe what you want in
04:32 plain language and it gives you a decent
04:34 looking React component to start from
04:36 it's not perfect but it saves hours and
04:38 that matters then there's Google Gemini
04:41 and Chat GPT i don't just use them to
04:43 solve bugs i treat them like mentors
04:46 i'll ask them to explain concepts give
04:48 me ideas or even pressure test my own
04:50 thinking it's like having a senior dev
04:53 on standby 24/7
04:55 the key is not getting overwhelmed with
04:57 too many tools i just focus on a few
04:59 that genuinely speed me up and remove
05:01 friction used well these tools make you
05:03 feel like a team of two not just
05:08 one you could build the most useful app
05:10 in the world but if no one knows it
05:13 exists it might as well not that's why I
05:16 treat marketing as an integral part of
05:17 the product not something you sprinkle
05:19 on at the end start by figuring out
05:21 where your ideal users spend time reddit
05:24 Twitter Discord Indie Hackers wherever
05:27 don't just drop links contribute to the
05:29 conversation share lessons learned give
05:31 feedback answer questions then when the
05:34 moment feels right introduce your
05:36 product in a natural way you'll also
05:38 need a landing page that converts the
05:40 formula is simple but powerful a clear
05:43 headline that communicates the value a
05:45 subheading that reinforces the problem
05:47 it solves and a visual or short video
05:49 that demonstrates how it works add in
05:52 some early testimonials or reviews to
05:54 build trust fast even if it's just
05:56 feedback from your first 10 users
05:58 speaking of which don't underestimate
06:00 the power of a short demo video just 30
06:03 to 60 seconds can be enough to show off
06:05 what your app does and why it matters
06:07 and remember your early users are
06:08 everything they're not just customers
06:10 they're testers evangelists and feedback
06:12 machines listen to them learn from them
06:15 and treat them like your founding team
06:17 i'll link some useful documents in the
06:19 description below
06:22 most profitable apps don't take off on
06:24 version one it's the second third or
06:27 10th iteration where things click so
06:30 after launch your job isn't done it's
06:32 just beginning start by talking to your
06:34 first users ask "What confused you what
06:37 did you like and dislike what would you
06:38 like to see improved?" Prioritize your
06:41 user feedback by using three simple
06:43 steps frequency how often your users are
06:47 mentioning the problem feasibility how
06:50 difficult is the task if it's quick and
06:51 easy then act on that straight away
06:54 impact what real value will this bring
06:57 to your users every DM comment or email
07:00 is a mini focus group when someone takes
07:02 the time to give feedback whether it's
07:04 positive or critical it's all gold take
07:07 notes look for patterns and prioritize
07:09 the pain points that keep coming up you
07:12 don't need to act on everything but you
07:13 do need to listen and the magic happens
07:16 when you respond publicly thank them
07:18 because at the end of the day they are
07:20 helping you to help them people remember
07:22 that it builds loyalty and momentum in
07:24 ways that are hard to fake so keep a
07:26 tight feedback loop because the best
07:27 version of your product is the one your
07:29 users help you build iterating isn't
07:31 glamorous but it's where profit lives
07:34 the builders who listen learn and adapt
07:36 they're the ones who turn side projects
07:38 into serious income if you take one
07:41 thing away from this video it's this
07:43 profitable apps are built with intention
07:45 not just by coding fast but by focusing
07:48 on real people clear problems and
07:50 constant feedback you don't need to be a
07:52 genius you just need a system feel free
