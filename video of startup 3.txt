From Zero to $42K/Month in 90 Days with AI

00:00 It took me 14 days to build
00:02 codeguide.dev and within 90 days we've
00:05 gone from 0 to 42K per month. This is
00:08 CJ, a longtime member of Starter Story.
00:11 And a few weeks ago, he sent me a DM
00:14 that blew me away. In just 49 days, he
00:17 took his app from 0 to $17,000 a month
00:20 without spending a single dollar on
00:23 marketing. But what's even crazier is he
00:26 didn't even build the product until he
00:28 knew it was validated. So I didn't build
00:31 any product. I didn't have anything. I
00:33 just had a glimpse of what a product can
00:35 look like in a landing page and people
00:37 were signing up from left and right. And
00:39 that was the moment when I decided,
00:41 okay, now I need to take this and create
00:43 like a proper tool that solves this
00:46 problem. Now I know what you're
00:47 thinking. He's probably got a huge
00:48 audience. But that's actually not true.
00:51 It all started when CJ set out to build
00:54 12 startups in 12 months, which
00:56 ultimately led him to an idea that would
00:59 change his life forever. I brought CJ
01:02 onto the channel to tell his story, and
01:04 he shared everything, including a full
01:07 breakdown of the tweet that broke his
01:09 startup, how he got thousands of signups
01:12 before writing any code, and the
01:14 unexpected marketing strategy that's
01:16 grown his business to over 500,000 in
01:19 ARR. If you're building an AI, this is a
01:22 mustwatch because this is what is
01:24 actually working right now. So, let's
01:27 get into it. I'm Pat Walls and this is
01:29 Starter
01:32 Story. All right, CJ, thanks for coming
01:34 on. Who are you and what's your story?
01:37 So, my name is Sajila Mazafir and people
01:39 on X know me by the name of CJZ. I'm the
01:42 founder of Code Guide, an AI startup
01:44 that helps AI developers write detailed
01:46 documentation for AI coding models. So
01:48 we launched on 24th of December and in
01:51 just last 3 months we've grown code
01:53 guide to 42k MRR with a community of
01:57 more than 4,800 AI developers and we're
01:60 projecting to cross around 90K this
02:02 month. 0 to 42,000 MR in just a couple
02:06 months is almost unheard of. So tell me
02:09 about what is the core issue that your
02:11 product solves and what made it grow so
02:13 fast? So basically code guide fixes a
02:15 core problem in AI coding which is AI
02:17 coding models are not ready yet. They
02:19 hallucinate, they assume things. So I
02:21 just tried to say fix just one problem
02:23 which is AI hallucinations by building a
02:26 knowledge base around the user's idea.
02:29 Our core users are pretty much beginners
02:31 to Sammy developers and they can attach
02:34 this knowledge base to these AI coding
02:35 tools. So you can say code guide is just
02:38 a bridge between two parties and that's
02:40 why it is growing really fast because
02:42 I'm not reinventing my own audience. I'm
02:45 just utilizing the AI coding tools
02:47 audience and we're just making the AI
02:49 coding workflow better. I mean that
02:51 growth is just amazing and I think that
02:53 there's something there. The opportunity
02:54 around building around AI and building
02:57 around AI apps. Why is AI coding such a
02:60 big opportunity right now? So, English
03:02 is the most prominent coding language
03:05 right now and that was not possible
03:07 before 2024. But now, if you know
03:09 English, you can literally code with AI.
03:11 AI is writing 25% of Google's code.
03:14 Cursor AI, which is just the top AI
03:17 coding tool that is one of the fastest
03:19 growing company right now. So if you
03:20 learn how AI works, how to prompt AI,
03:25 you can actually build a really
03:27 profitable application right now that
03:28 you can deploy online and make money
03:30 from it. And people are doing that. You
03:32 don't need to learn code. You just learn
03:34 how to talk to this AI and AI can
03:36 execute code and build you the
03:38 applications. What I think is it's
03:40 amazing what you built and I know that
03:41 you were a member of Starter Story for
03:43 some time. I'd love if you could just
03:44 briefly break down your backstory and
03:47 how you got into building online. Uh I
03:49 moved to Canada in 2018 and I did my
03:51 first 9 to5 and that was like a horrible
03:54 experience for me. I knew like I can't
03:56 do any 9 to5. So I went back to the
03:58 drawing board and stick to my basics
04:01 which is like just build stuff, just do
04:03 something. And I built a lot of
04:04 agencies, built a lot of software
04:06 products, SAS products, you name it. And
04:09 then in 2022, I was actually writing a
04:12 lot of tweets about AI prompting and I
04:15 knew that AI coding is actually blowing
04:18 up uh at the back end and people are not
04:20 noticing it. So I wanted to force myself
04:23 to actually learn the craft, build and
04:26 code with AI coding tools for like 10 to
04:29 12 hours per day. And I just, you know,
04:31 publicly announced that I'll be doing 12
04:33 startups. And I ended up building 11
04:36 products of my own. Unfortunately, 10
04:39 collapsed. They didn't perform well, but
04:41 one of them grew really fast, which is
04:43 code guide. And then in the end, you
04:46 know, it was just like an overnight
04:47 success after like all these seven
04:49 years. And that's why I'm super stoked.
04:51 I'm working 9 to 10 hours every single
04:53 day just to make this product better,
04:55 just to make it the best product out
04:57 there for AI coders. So, you built a
05:00 bunch of stuff, but let's talk about how
05:02 you found the idea that really kind of
05:04 changed your life, right? How did you
05:06 actually find this idea? I was just
05:08 trying to solve my own problem with code
05:10 guide. Actually, like I said, I was
05:12 running an MVP agency and for each
05:14 project, I had to chat with chat GPT for
05:18 like 9 to 10 hours to create all these
05:20 technical documentations to create a
05:22 knowledge base that I can attach to
05:24 these uh AI coding tools. So, I turned
05:27 my uh prompts into like a sequence using
05:31 make.com and I literally saved seven
05:33 hours out of those nine hours and that
05:36 was magical for me. And then I created a
05:38 landing page in like 30 minutes using
05:40 Bolt and within 2 weeks we got 1,800
05:44 weight list uh signups. Nice. That's
05:46 great. I would just love to hear a
05:48 little bit more about your process for
05:50 validating an idea. How did you know
05:52 code guide was validated? Yes. So,
05:55 Twitter is actually a really great
05:57 platform to launch products. All you
05:59 need to do is just share your screen,
06:01 create a simple uh screen recording
06:03 demo, and you just post it and this type
06:05 of content usually goes viral. So, in
06:07 this tweet, I'm just talking about like
06:10 what is my ideal cursor workflow. I just
06:13 tweeted that out and I was just mind
06:15 blown that how many people were actually
06:17 struggling with hallucination problem
06:19 with AI. And then I just turned this
06:22 thing into a landing page in like 20
06:23 minutes. the max using bolt and actual
06:26 validation for me was when people
06:28 starting to sign up. So I got more than
06:31 1,800 weight list emails in like two
06:33 weeks. That was the first stage of
06:35 validation for me that people actually
06:37 want this uh solution. And then uh I was
06:40 just talking to all the beta users. I I
06:43 was trying to DM them. every single one
06:45 that was commenting me just to asking
06:47 them uh either they are using some other
06:49 flow to remove or fix the AI
06:52 hallucinations and nobody was actually
06:54 tackling in a better way than what we
06:56 were trying to do. So that was the
06:58 second stage of validation and then that
06:60 was the moment when I decided okay now I
07:02 need to take this and you know put all
07:05 my effort into it and create like a
07:07 proper tool that solves this problem. I
07:09 want to change the subject a little bit
07:11 to building I want to know how you
07:13 actually built this. So, could you walk
07:14 through your step-by-step process for
07:16 how you went from idea to actual
07:19 launched app? Sure. So, when I tweeted
07:22 that and we got like 400 retweets and I
07:25 got like 300 signups, that was a
07:28 different feeling for me and I knew like
07:30 okay I am up to something. So what I did
07:32 was I just sat for next you know 10 to
07:36 12 hours just documenting what can be
07:39 the best UI and how I can take this
07:42 thing to the production stage and then
07:44 spent like next 3 days just to design
07:47 the proper front end so I can visualize
07:49 it. Once I did that I realized I can't
07:52 do it myself because I have to launch it
07:54 fast. So I just reached out to my friend
07:56 and I said hey I'll take care of the
07:58 front end and the marketing side. can
08:00 you do the back end and just the
08:02 customer service and he was very stoked
08:04 about this idea because we were coding
08:07 uh with AI for all these uh months. So
08:09 now he tesares of the back end still
08:11 we're just team of two and I take care
08:13 of the front end. So it took us just two
08:15 weeks to uh actually from that's just a
08:19 raw UI to have a proper responsive web
08:22 app launched for our users and we got uh
08:26 100 users the first day of launch. That
08:28 was on 24th of December 2024. I just
08:32 love CJ's story because it's proof that
08:35 sometimes it's just about being in the
08:37 right space at the right time. You got
08:39 to try a lot of things, but when you
08:40 finally find something that works,
08:42 you're ready. And I really think that
08:43 space right now is building in AI. Look,
08:47 these AI coding tools are powerful, but
08:49 they're still not magic yet. It's still
08:52 really early days and the space can feel
08:54 overwhelming if you don't have the right
08:56 system or framework to follow. So,
08:58 shameless plug here, but we've been
08:59 working on something for a while. It's
09:01 called Starter Story Build, our platform
09:04 for learning everything AI tools in Vibe
09:07 Coding. Our flagship program is the AI
09:09 app accelerator where in about two weeks
09:12 without knowing how to code, you'll
09:14 ideulate, build, and launch a real life
09:16 production app using all AI tools. Just
09:19 like CJ, we've been running this program
09:21 for a while behind the scenes. And every
09:23 day, I'm blown away by the stuff being
09:25 built in there and just how fast things
09:28 are moving. But this is way more than
09:30 something you could get in a course
09:31 because you walk away with a real world
09:33 app completely built with AI plus skills
09:37 that might just change your life. Not
09:39 only will you learn how to use these
09:40 tools and to build stuff you never
09:42 thought possible, but the program will
09:44 also give you structure, accountability,
09:46 and push you to actually take action,
09:48 get it done, and ship it. What's even
09:51 cooler is that we have office hours with
09:53 AI coding experts to help you when you
09:55 get stuck and a whole cohort of other
09:57 people building alongside you. So, if
09:59 you're curious about building an app
10:00 like CJ and you want to surround
10:02 yourself with other builders in AI, then
10:04 head to the first link in the
10:05 description to see if the AI app
10:07 accelerator might be worth it for you.
10:09 But we're keeping it small right now
10:10 because we're focused on quality. So,
10:13 please make sure to head to that first
10:14 link, put your email in if you want to
10:16 save your spot. Now, let's get back to
10:18 CJ. Okay, so you launched it. This kind
10:20 of tweet thread blew up. Let's go deeper
10:23 into the marketing. What's been working
10:24 for you to market your SAS and grow the
10:27 SAS since then? If I have to go all over
10:30 again, I would do this playbook which is
10:32 content audience fit approach. You need
10:34 to talk to users. What is the core
10:36 problem and how you can fix it? I would
10:39 literally go push content for next 14
10:41 days, warm up my audience and then from
10:43 there I pick up what are their main core
10:45 pain points and for those pain point
10:48 what is the major one and then I just
10:51 build a product that fix just one
10:53 problem and then I push that product to
10:56 that core group that gave me my initial
10:58 users and from their own words I would
11:00 just double down on the content that
11:02 works and I will find more people like
11:05 the core audience and that's how you can
11:07 grow and I coined this term called
11:10 tutorial marketing. And what I do every
11:12 single day is I just write a tutorial in
11:14 the form of thread or long form tweet.
11:16 And what I do is I write four threads
11:19 per week and three long form posts. I
11:22 just pick one topic, write a draft and
11:25 then the next day I just edit that draft
11:27 with clear mind. Then I design assets
11:30 using Canva and Figma. So in this
11:32 tutorial, same playbook. uh in the hook
11:35 you actually talk about the problem and
11:37 then you show them the exact blueprint
11:40 what's the ideal solution and then you
11:43 position your SAS in between just a part
11:45 of the solution that type of content
11:47 actually performs really well because
11:49 that's bookmarkable content and sharable
11:51 content if your content is bookmarked
11:54 algorithm is in your side and people
11:56 love that and you build credibility and
11:58 trust so that's how my turn rate is
12:00 super low right now and we're growing at
12:02 massive pace Nice. You're posting on
12:05 Twitter, you're getting lots of
12:06 attention, but how do you actually
12:08 convert that into users and then to
12:10 paying customers? Sure. My funnel is
12:12 super simple. You just write content
12:15 every single day and push that audience
12:18 or traffic to your weight list landing
12:20 page and you collect those emails
12:22 because from those emails you will get
12:25 your first 100 customers because they
12:27 already know that this is the pain that
12:29 they want to solve and they also trust
12:32 you and that's why they gave you your
12:34 email address. Cool. Okay. So, can you
12:36 just explain your business model and
12:38 your pricing? Sure. So, our business
12:40 model is pretty straightforward. We're
12:42 not doing any trials because we're using
12:45 top-of-the-line AI models and AI models
12:48 right now are not cheap. So, we're using
12:50 a mixture of models to create these well
12:53 structured documentation. Uh users can
12:55 literally go to our landing page. They
12:57 can sign up either for monthly
12:59 membership which is right now at $29
13:02 that will be $39 to $49 in next 6
13:05 months. And we're also doing a heavy 40%
13:09 uh discount on yearly membership which
13:11 also comes with different perks like we
13:13 have official partnership with cursor AI
13:16 uh vinsurf bolt loable and all the top
13:18 EI coding tools. Cool. Okay. Tell me
13:21 about the tools, languages and
13:25 everything you use to build and run this
13:27 business. So for a code guide, I use
13:30 those texts that are basically favored
13:33 by AI coding models. So the for the
13:35 front end we're using Nex.js and for
13:38 cloud we use it to design our UI
13:40 components that using 3.7 model and that
13:43 costs $20. For cursor basically this is
13:46 our main IDE where we code all our stuff
13:49 uh that cost us $20. Windsurf is another
13:52 AI IDE that we use $15 a month.
13:54 Superbase all our backend is postgrql
13:57 superbase so $25 a month and that covers
14:00 our database and storage. Uh, Versell is
14:03 where we deploy all our apps. So, $48 a
14:06 month. Hatchner is basically our cloud
14:09 storage server. It costs us $25. The
14:12 biggest bill is OpenAI API which is
14:15 $2,800. Then we also use Cloud API and
14:18 that costs us $300 plus. Gemini Flash
14:22 API is free right now. Clerk Dev is for
14:24 user authentication. That's a very good
14:26 tool. Then we use ConvertKit to send
14:28 emails to our users. that cost us $45 a
14:31 month. So, all in all, cost is around
14:33 like $3,500 per month. And obviously,
14:36 we're not doing any paid marketing yet.
14:39 Uh we're doing everything organically
14:41 from user acquisition to converting them
14:44 uh into a paid user. Everything is
14:46 organic. All my traffic is coming from
14:48 X. So, that's why the margins are are
14:51 higher. Let's move on to a little bit of
14:53 personal stuff. So, uh you live in uh
14:55 Vancouver, you mentioned um and now you
14:57 got the successful startup. Tell me what
14:59 a day in the life is like for CJ. Sure.
15:02 Um, so I wake up super early, like 5:00
15:04 a.m. and I just take a shower, go for
15:07 prayer, and start my 2 hours of deep
15:10 work session just like you. Um, then I
15:12 just go for a walk and start my second
15:14 session which involves research, coding,
15:17 writing content. Uh, then I take
15:19 networking calls in the afternoon and
15:21 then in the evening I listen to my
15:23 favorite podcast, read a book for 10
15:26 minutes and then write my schedule for
15:28 the next day. So, super simple, no fancy
15:30 routines, but that I I'm sticking with
15:32 this routine for the last one year now.
15:34 One thing I think is cool is that the
15:36 reason why we're talking right now is
15:38 that you actually sent me a message
15:39 inside the Starter Story community.
15:41 You've been a member of Starter Story
15:42 for some time and when I saw your
15:44 message, I was just like so impressed
15:46 with what you built. But I'd just love
15:47 to hear about your experience joining
15:49 Starter Story and how it helped you uh
15:51 get to this place where you now have
15:53 this successful startup. Sure. Um, and
15:56 I'm not promoting Starter Story. I
15:57 actually got really good value out of
15:59 starter story. There's a lot of valuable
16:02 case studies which I used actually to
16:05 learn a lot about marketing myself like
16:07 how this guy actually created this idea,
16:10 what was his flow and then how he ended
16:12 up you know got like paying users. So I
16:14 read like more than 100 plus uh you know
16:17 case studies there. So starter story is
16:19 like a huge asset for me personally and
16:22 then when I reach somewhere you were the
16:24 first guy that I reached out to on on
16:26 Slack that this is what I built this is
16:28 what we're trying to do just asking for
16:29 different suggestions or advice from you
16:31 and then yeah here we are right now.
16:35 Cool man that's awesome. Well really the
16:37 last question that I want to ask you is
16:40 you know AI right now is really
16:42 overwhelming. you know, things are
16:43 changing so fast. You managed to find a
16:45 way to make it work and you're already
16:47 thinking ahead about the next thing.
16:49 What advice would you have for someone
16:50 watching this who wants to get into AI
16:53 and building ideas and shipping ideas in
16:55 the crazy world of AI? Sure. Uh, I think
16:59 we are living in the best time to build
17:02 software or any sort of product online.
17:05 All you need to do is just make yourself
17:07 AI native. The first step can be just go
17:10 on chat GPT and have a chat with this AI
17:14 and you will know like how amazing this
17:16 thing is. Next step can be you can
17:18 literally go have a voicetooice
17:20 conversation just brainstorm just uh
17:23 improve a skill set with that so you
17:25 understand like okay this is not a
17:27 bubble this is not a trend this is
17:29 actually a lot bigger than that and from
17:31 there onwards uh you can just start
17:34 coding. English is the hottest
17:36 programming language right now. So all
17:37 you need to do is use AI for research
17:40 about the market, then write code, then
17:42 write content, and then distribute the
17:43 product. So every single thing or every
17:46 piece of the puzzle is just right there
17:48 for you. All you need to do is create
17:49 your own canvas. All right. Well, that's
17:52 the best advice I've heard all month.
17:54 Thanks for coming on, CJ. It was it was
17:56 just so cool to see and enjoyed having
17:58 you. Thanks, Pat. Thanks for having me.
18:00 Love the conversation. So I want to
18:02 thank CJ for coming on. And when I look
18:04 at his story, I want to say that CJ had
18:07 some formula for success, but I just
18:10 don't think that's the case. He just got
18:12 started, shipped a bunch of stuff, and
18:14 while doing that, he eventually kind of
18:16 stumbled into an idea that changed his
18:18 life. I see a lot of people waiting,
18:20 waiting for the right time to start and
18:23 sitting on the sidelines. And then I see
18:24 others who are just getting started,
18:26 playing around with these tools, and
18:28 shipping stuff every week. If you got
18:30 started today, imagine where you'd be in
18:32 2 weeks. What's crazy about these AI
18:34 tools is basically you can build
18:36 anything you want without having to be
18:38 an engineer or knowing how to code. Yes,
18:40 it's early and not everything is
18:42 perfect, but the early bird gets the
18:45 bag. So, if you're serious about
18:46 building something, just click the first
18:48 link in the description and let's build.
18:51 All right, I'll see you guys in the next
18:52 one. Peace.
